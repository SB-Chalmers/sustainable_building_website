    abstract={This paper introduces a new method to account for the stocks and flows of road infrastructure at the national level based on material flow accounting (MFA). The proposed method closes some of the current shortcomings in road infrastructures that were identified through MFA: (1) the insufficient implementation of prospective analysis, (2) heavy use of archetypes as a way to represent road infrastructure, (3) inadequate attention to the inclusion of dissipative flows, and (4) limited coverage of the uncertainties. The proposed dynamic bottom-up MFA method was tested on the Norwegian road network to estimate and predict the material stocks and flows between 1980 and 2050. Here, a supervised machine learning model was introduced to estimate the road infrastructure instead of archetypical mapping of different roads. The dissipation of materials from the road infrastructure based on tire-pavement interaction was incorporated. Moreover, this study utilizes iterative classified and regression trees, lifetime distributions, randomized material intensities, and sensitivity analyses to quantify the uncertainties.  },

    abstract={This two-wave study (time lag of six months and two years post-relocation) investigated ways in which employees’ perceptions of the office environment relate to their perceived health in the long term, drawing on the salutogenic approach to health and the sense of coherence theory (comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness). A mixed-method approach was adopted. The data collection involved semi-structured interviews with employees, plus structured observations. The findings indicate that employees found the office environment less comprehensible and meaningful in Wave 2, while (somewhat) equally manageable. Comprehensibility was influenced by a lack of clear behavioural rules; manageability was influenced by a lack of control over the environment; and meaningfulness was influenced by social environment and lack of personalization. The contextual aspects of the office, including tasks, flexible working culture and the change processes were critical to these findings. This study has demonstrated that negative influences caused by poor design choices do not resolve themselves over time. When there is limited support for one component of sense of coherence, the initial observed benefits wear off and negative influences may spill over into other components. Therefore, office design should be approached with balanced attention to comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness.  },

    title={Healthy Offices: Conceptualizing Healthy Activity-based Offices},
    year={2022},
    abstract={This thesis explores the interrelations between the design characteristics of activity-based offices, users’ perceptions of them, and users’ sense of coherence. The goal is twofold: (i) contribute to conceptualizations of healthy activity-based offices and (ii) facilitate practical use of the sense of coherence theory for office designers. Most research into healthy offices has focused on harm-causing factors (pathogenic aspects) while overlooking the health-promoting design characteristics in activity-based offices (salutogenic aspects). This thesis is a response to the call for a paradigm shift and explores the particular design characteristics of activity-based offices that promote health, drawing on the salutogenic approach and sense of coherence theory. The thesis builds on a literature review and two mixed methods case studies on activity-based offices. Drawing on the sense of coherence framework, three types of design characteristics were identified: (i) those that promote a clear understanding of office environments, (ii) those that enhance users' access to relevant resources, and (iii) those that evoke meaning for users to cope with stressors. These characteristics and the perceptions of them are interrelated meaning that they can have multiple impacts on users’ sense of coherence. The findings also highlighted temporal changes in users’ perceptions, indicating that novelties of the new office wore off and the initial problems observed in the office environment worsened. Moreover, activity-based offices were not always perceived as intended because of suboptimal design solutions and contextual factors. In conclusion, there are no definitive answers to how to design healthy activity-based offices. Activity-based offices are complex environments and consist of many interacting aspects including the design characteristics, individuals’, and their work-related prerequisite as well as organization-related factors that influence users’ perceptions and their sense of coherence. The framework developed in this thesis may contribute to better-informed discussions about designing for sense of coherence. The thesis suggests that healthy activity-based offices should be viewed as a "moving project" that develops over time through experimentation and adaptation, with management’s involvement. Thus, a healthy activity-based office provides users resources and opportunities to codesign an environment that enables them (i) build meaningful social relationships, (ii) manage visual and acoustic distractions, (iii) read and understand workspaces, and (iv) receive support from management in their daily work.  },

    abstract={Boosting building renovation is urgently needed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Building retrofit can be achieved by energy-efficient measures such as thermal insulation or replacement of a fossil heating system. Currently, conventional materials that are mostly used for envelope insulation raising the risk of a lock-in situation where measures to mitigate climate change are actually contributing to it. Bio-based materials are a promising alternative as they can be used to not only reduce the energy consumption of a building but also temporarily store carbon. To evaluate the potential benefits of such materials, life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) are commonly used. Such assessment allows the analysis of a building over its whole life. However, considering that buildings are very long lasting systems, many associated uncertainties can affect the outcome of LCA and LCCA. To account for all the uncertainty sources and provide a robust solution for building renovation, uncertainty quantification can be applied. In this paper, we use robust optimization under uncertainties to define the most cost-effective and climate-friendly solution. We apply bio-based materials and include carbon storage calculation in the integrated LCA and LCCA. For the robust optimization, we use a novel methodology combining a well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) with surrogate modeling to lower computational cost. The methodology is applied for a case study located in Switzerland. The results show that bio-based materials provide a robust solution for building renovation but to achieve the highest reduction potential, bio-based envelope insulation should be combined with the replacement of the existing fossil heating system.  },

    abstract={The Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) for existing dwellings has not been able to promote the renovation rate. The main reasons are associated with the low quality of the assessment and renovation recommendations provided. These are not able to provide the information or confidence needed to undertake a renovation project. So far, neither reports for the EPBD nor studies by researchers have proposed modifications to the model used to assess existing buildings under the EPBD. The present research proposes a procedure to evaluate, design improvements, store and share data on the renovation process of each building. Specifically, the procedure is based on three steps, the first one is to apply simplified measurements on the dwelling, laser scanning and envelope testing. The second stage, using the electricity consumption data, was to calibrate and calculate the thermal properties of the building. Finally, tailor-made recommendations for the whole life cycle of the house are proposed and stored in a database. After an optimisation and life cycle analysis of different measurement packages. The results show that by incorporating currently available tools, such as scanners, smart meters and BIM, a complete building condition profile can be obtained, stored and shared, and renovation measures with their benefits and costs can be realistically proposed. This study is in line with what has been proposed by previous studies, the need to digitise the certification system, to use new technologies and to capture the trust of the users.  },

    abstract={As the high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by the construction and real estate sector receive more attention, more and more countries include an environmental assessment of buildings based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in their building regulations. Sweden introduced mandatory climate declarations in January 2022, for example. To support stakeholders in conducting the climate declarations and using the results to reduce GHG emissions, user-friendly tools for early planning stages are needed. The aim of this study is to develop and test a framework for user centric development of such tools. The framework builds on three steps; 1) interviewing stakeholders to define tool requirements, 2) developing a prototype tool according to the requirements, and 3) evaluating it based on user feedback. We developed and tested the framework in the Swedish context to provide a blueprint applicable to other countries and contexts. The primary target users are architects with computational design experience but also engineers and real estate developers working in early phases. The results show that the users' expectations can be met when the requirements are integrated from the very beginning. In the current version, the developed building LCA tool only targets the embodied GHG emissions from the production and construction phase of the building, but it could be extended to include further life cycle phases in the future.  },

This paper aims to provide a systematic, interoperable, and open-source approach towards implementing LCSA in Building Information Modelling (BIM) in five steps. A harmonized data structure that enriches BIM objects is proposed. Automation in the principal evaluation step is provided by integrating new parameters into the current Industry Foundation Classes (IFC4). A Dynamo script verifies its utility in a case study in Spain using real-time calculations and visualizations. Two alternative structural systems are assessed, and identification is made of the lowest CO2 emitter, the lowest cost, and the most beneficial system for local employment. The approach can be employed to evaluate other indicators and building systems in other countries. Challenges and limitations in the standardization and harmonization of the three dimensions are identified.  },

För att kunna genomföra studien med en socioteknisk inriktning valde vi att använda KTH Live-in-Lab som testmiljö med dess ingående nätverk av flera olika typer av aktörer. Vi såg en möjlighet att öka interaktionen mellan byggnadssystemen i sig och mänskliga aktivitetssystem genom att tillämpa tjänstesystemsintegration. Med andra ord syftar denna avhandling på att undersöka hur nya tjänster i byggd miljö kan utformas för att kunna assistera slutanvändares dagliga aktiviteter och välmående. Samtidigt syftar avhandlingen till att supportera en mer hållbar byggnadsdrift så som att minska användandet av el och vatten samt minskning av avfallsproduktion. För att kunna ta ett bredare grepp om tjänsteutveckling inom byggd miljö inledde vi studierna genom att tillämpa T-Shape-metoden som forskningsansats. För den bredare utforskningsdelen använde vi Delphi-metoden där vi arbetade med samdesign och skapa konsensus mellan flera olika aktörer. Insikterna från den bredare studien skapade en bas för utformning av fördjupade studier vid vilka en blandning av både kvalitativa och kvantitativa metoder användes (utvärderingar kring hållbar mat och sömnkvalitetfallstudier). Resultatet av bredd- och djupstudierna består av både teoretiska och praktiska implikationer. Från ett teoretiskt perspektiv bidrog vi till att förbättra tjänsteutformningsprocessen för byggda miljöer. Detta gjordes genom att använda KTH Live-in-Lab- koncept och - miljö som bas för utformning av ett ramverk där syftet är att skapa ett ömsesidigt värdeutbyte mellan byggnadssystem och mänskliga aktivitetssystem. I praktiken utformade vi, tillsammans med flera olika aktörer, en tjänstekonceptsportfölj för KTH Live-in-Lab och testade två olika koncept med hjälp av aktivt deltagande från de boende i denna miljö. Alla insikter och slutsatser från de utvalda ämnena i denna avhandling har presenterats i fyra vetenskapliga artiklar och två konferensartiklar. Nyckelord: tjänstedesign, mänskligt aktivitetssystem, byggnadssystem, servicesystem, aktörsnätverksanalys, living lab, hållbart byggande.  },

    abstract={Buildings are responsible for 38% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and, therefore, pathways to reduce their impact are crucial to achieve climate targets. Building stock energy models (BSEMs) have long been used as a tool to assess the current and future energy demand and environmental impact of building stocks. BSEMs have become more and more complex and are often tailored to case-specific datasets, which results in a high degree of heterogeneity among models. This heterogeneity, together with a lack of consistency in the reporting hinders the understanding of these models and, thereby, an accurate interpretation and comparison of results. In this paper we present a reporting guideline in order to improve reporting practices of BSEMs. The guideline was developed by experts as part of the IEA's Annex 70 and builds upon reporting guidelines from other fields. It consists of five topics (Overview, Model Components, Input and Output, Quality Assurance and Additional Information), which are further subdivided into subtopics. We explain which model aspects should be described in each subtopic, and provide illustrative examples on how to apply the guideline. The reporting guideline is consistent with the model classification framework and online model registry also developed in the Annex.  },

    abstract={Industrial Symbiosis (IS) can reduce industrial waste and the need for virgin material extraction by utilizing waste generated by one industry as a raw material for another. Input-output matching is a commonly used approach for identifying potential IS partnerships. Usually, to collect necessary data for input-output matching, companies are asked to participate in workshops or surveys. However, such activities can be costly and time consuming. Additionally, companies may be unwilling to participate due to issues around data confidentiality. This article aims to show how these barriers can be overcome by a new method for identification of IS opportunities, which does not require companies to be surveyed. The developed matching approach uses statistical datasets and IS databases. The underlying principle is to use known IS partnerships and databases developed by the authors containing data on typical waste generation and resource use by industries, to expand and link other potential donors and receivers. This allows the expansion of one IS example into multiple potential relationships. The method promotes Circular Economy development by identifying more opportunities to utilize more secondary resources through connecting previously unrelated industry sectors. The method has been tested in Sweden, where the goal was to identify potential partnerships between industries that generate sawdust as a waste product and companies that could utilize sawdust in their industrial processes. Out of 6,726,534 potential symbiotic links identified by the method, 159,630 were shortlisted using prioritization criteria reflecting an increased likelihood of symbiosis.  },

The purpose of this study is to report the pedagogical approaches taken and to understand whether these fostered the candidates’ ability to develop systemic solutions and professional competency. Design/methodology/approach: Twenty doctoral candidates from various backgrounds participated in a two-week summer school organized by a consortium of four universities. Interdisciplinary groups worked on real-life challenges using a systemic approach to co-create tangible solutions. To support the creation of socio-technical innovations, stakeholders and experts from different fields were involved. The participants completed two questionnaires during the summer school to help elucidate their learning experiences. Findings: The doctoral candidates showed strong willingness to cooperate across disciplines, though they found it important to connect this learning experience to their research. The candidates reported that the experience enhanced their ability to work in a multidisciplinary capacity. The experience identified a solid basis for interdisciplinary learning principles that could be replicated.

    year={2022},
    abstract={The primary goal of the built environment is to create the infrastructure that facilitates the needs of the people that use them and elevate their quality of life. Sustainable development has encouraged architects and urban planners to be more sensitive toward the built environment's economic, environmental, and social dimensions. Digital tools for performance assessment are commonly used to shorten the feedback loop in testing designs for buildings and neighbourhoods. However, these tools do not extend to the social dimension in the same way as the economic and environmental dimensions. This thesis aims to contribute to USS research and bridge the gap between theory and practice through digitalisation. It investigates USS in general and explores how it can be conceptualised and made operational to support architects and urban planners in their design process. The focus is on digital tools and how they can be integrated into the current architectural and urban design process. Two studies are carried out (A and B). Based on systematic literature analysis, study A explores the theoretical background of USS. It investigates the reasons for the lack of consensus on USS's conceptualisation and how digital tools can be developed around these issues. Study B explores the development of an indicator to support practitioners in evaluating the ability of residents to achieve their daily needs and uses interviews with practitioners for feedback on the indicator and how it can be improved. The findings indicate that USS is a complex and often "fuzzy" topic. There are many definitions for USS but little consensus among them. By viewing USS as an empty signifier, stakeholders can collaboratively decide what social themes are important to them. Two categories of social themes are identified - social equity and social capital. Focusing on social and spatial equity, a USS indicator called Trip Completion Rate is developed and used to explore the ability of residents to fulfil their daily needs through examples. The interviews with practitioners suggest that an indicator for evaluating social issues is appreciated, but further development is required in communicating complex results to stakeholders. In conclusion, the findings of this thesis contribute to a better understanding of USS and how to operationalise it for architects and urban planners through indicators. To further advance the integration of USS into the design process of neighbourhoods, digital tools must focus on enhancing social equity in the built environment. Finally, it identifies the indicators, methods and future pathways to advance the design of socially sustainable neighbourhoods through digitalisation.  },

    abstract={Timber roof constructions are commonly ventilated through an air cavity beneath the roof sheathing in order to remove heat and moisture from the construction. The driving forces for this ventilation are wind pressure and thermal buoyancy. The wind driven ventilation has been studied extensively, while models for predicting buoyant flow are less developed. In the present study, a novel analytical model is presented to predict the air flow caused by thermal buoyancy in a ventilated roof construction. The model provides means to calculate the cavity Rayleigh number for the roof construction, which is then correlated with the air flow rate. The model predictions are compared to the results of an experimental and a numerical study examining the effect of different cavity designs and inclinations on the air flow rate in a ventilated roof subjected to varying heat loads. Over 80 different test set-ups, the analytical model was found to replicate both experimental and numerical results within an acceptable margin. The effect of an increased total roof height, air cavity height and solar heat load for a given construction is an increased air flow rate through the air cavity. On average, the analytical model predicts a 3% higher air flow rate than found in the numerical study, and a 20% lower air flow rate than found in the experimental study, for comparable test set-ups. The model provided can be used to predict the air flow rate in cavities of varying design, and to quantify the impact of suggested roof design changes. The result can be used as a basis for estimating the moisture safety of a roof construction.  },

    abstract={To achieve carbon targets, the European Union (EU) aims to promote nearly zero-energy buildings (nZEB). To enable the necessary transition, technical solutions need to converge with socio-economic factors, such values and awareness of stakeholders involved in the decision-making process. In this light, the aim of this paper is to characterise perceived drivers and barriers to nine energy-efficient technologies (EET), according to key decision-makers' and persuaders of the technology selection in the EU residential building context. Results are collected across eight EU countries, i.e. Belgium (BE), Germany (DE), Spain (ES), France (FR), Italy (IT), Netherlands (NL), Poland (PL), and United Kingdom (UK). The stakeholders’ selected are architects, construction companies, engineers, installers and demand-side actors. Data from a multi-country survey is analysed to calculate the share of 15 drivers and 21 barriers (aggregated to 5 groups), being selected for each EET and country. The 5 groups considered to analyse drivers and barriers are environmental, technical, economic, social, legal. The perceived barriers and drivers were further studied for their association across the countries using the Pearson's Chi2 and a Cramer's V tests. The results demonstrate that across all EETs and countries, the technical and economic driver groups are perceived to have the highest potential to increase the implementation rate of EET. In terms of barriers, economic aspects are seen as the foremost reason that EET are not scaling faster. In both drivers and barriers legal aspects are the least often selected. In overall the barrier groups show significant variation across countries compared to driver groups. These findings provide an evidence-basis to better understand arguments in favour and against specific EETs and, in this way, support policy makers and other interested parties to increase the market share of the selected solutions.  },

In this light, the aim of this paper is to advance in the understanding of the probability of certain EERMs taking place in eight EU countries, according to a set of parameters, such as building typology, project types, and motivation behind the project. Using these parameters collected via a multi-country online survey, a set of discrete-choice (conditional logit) models are estimated on the probability of selecting a choice of any combination of 33 EERMs across the sampled countries. Results show that actions related to the building envelope are the most often-addressed across countries and single building elements or technology measures have a higher probability of being implemented. The modelling framework developed in this study contributes to the scientific community in three ways: (1) establishing an empirical relationship among EERMs and project (i.e., retrofit and deep retrofit), (2) identifying commonalities and differences across the selected countries, and (3) quantifying the probabilities and market shares of various EERMs.  },

The studied geometries are primarily spaces for communication and leisure in residential buildings. These spaces may have a varying indoor climate, which is governed by the construction of the building, as well as residents’ activities, rather than by building services. The project contributes with examples of geometries and usages, methods to evaluate the performance early in the design process and to provide guidance for architectural design and increased social interaction. The project also investigates obstacles that exist in current practice and Swedish legislation for glazed geometries. In this report, the first part of the project “Inventory of geometries and functions by study visits and interviews” is presented. Methods used in this first part is literature studies, interviews and case studies. The topics investigated are social and human aspects, technical aspects such as thermal comfort, energy, air quality, humidity, acoustics and to some extent urban farming. From the literature and by contacting architects and consultants in the building industry, eight case study buildings were found, located. The buildings were either housing cooperatives or rental buildings, and the glazed spaces in the buildings were either atria, glazed balconies or glazed rooftops. For the case studies, information was gathered from databases, through interviews and during study visits. The opinions of the residents were captured during structured interviews and through quantifiable surveys, and the results were analysed by the project group with input from the reference group. For social interaction, the investigations show that even with a developed design for social interaction (such as common areas, kindergarden, private areas in connection with glazed space), the interaction might fail. Social activities are highly dependent on individuals and thus, engaged persons are very valuable to obtain a social environment. In addition, a clear purpose of the space and a sense of ownership is beneficial to the social environment. In this study, the projects that worked well socially were the four housing cooperatives and one rental building. The three projects that worked less well were all rental. There are slightly different opinions of the optimal size to achieve social interaction. The architect of one of the projects that works well socially suggests a maximum of 60 persons (25-30 families) and at another socially successful building, there are 48 apartments. Two out of the three largest buildings (71 apartments and 126 apartments) did not function well socially. Daylight levels are usually considered good in the glazed spaces. However, there are darker areas, in particular under access balconies, and this also affects the daylight levels in the apartments. The air quality is usually perceived as good in the glazed spaces and the most common problem connected to air quality is a high level of moisture in the air, which can result in condensation on windows. For thermal comfort, the expected level of comfort is important for the experience of the space. If the space looks like it is indoor, the expectation is room temperature in wintertime and, consequently, people are disappointed if it’s much colder. Both studied rooftops have problems with high temperatures in summertime. The temperature in the glazed space depends to a large degree on shading and ventilation, but also on the thermal mass of the materials in the glazed space. This is further investigated in part 2 of the project (Wahlgren et al. 2021), where also evaluation tools and design guidelines are presented.  },

This paper explores this challenge in the context of the Design and Planning for Social Inclusion master’s course within architecture, at Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden). It examines the pedagogical and societal contribution arising from a systematic use of a digital whiteboard as a collaborative tool, following an interlinked process of co-creation in which stakeholders and students interact continuously to co-create architectural and urban design proposals. Results of such an innovative process can be used to revisit the impact of Covid-19 on students’ work and highlight positive and unexpected discoveries, and at the same time integrate feedback from local community and stakeholders, contributing to societal outreach and architectural practice.  },

    abstract={This study investigated the current design circumstances of an office as well as employees’ perceptions of the office environment in relation to their perceived health, drawing on sense of coherence theory (comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness). Previous studies have related the physical office environment to employee health. However, most studies have focused on alleviating negative effects, while health-promoting potential, including employee sense of coherence, has been overlooked. This study adopted a mixed method case study approach, combining semi-structured interviews with employees, structured observations, and analysis of architectural drawings. The results indicated that employees’ perceptions did not always align with the ideas behind the architectural design and that employees understood the environment differently. The study also highlighted the interrelations (and contradictions) among the different components of sense of coherence. The findings imply that organizations may need to prioritize which components of coherence should be supported most by the office environment. It also suggests that case-specific design aspects should play a more central role in studying and conceptualizing healthy office design and that design solutions should be continuously modified during the use phase, while ensuring employees’ participation. The study concluded that an ‘ideal’ office environment should not be the goal. Instead, office design should provide an environment in which employees are able to cope with challenges in comprehensible, manageable and meaningful ways.  },

    abstract={Buildings are responsible for a large share of CO2 emissions in the world. Building renovation is crucial to decrease the environmental impact and meet the United Nations climate action goals. However, due to buildings’ long service lives, there are many uncertainties that might cause a deviation in the results of a predicted retrofit outcome. In this paper, we determine climate-friendly and cost-effective renovation scenarios for two typical buildings with low and high energy performance in Switzerland using a methodology of robust optmization. First, we create an integrated model for life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA). Second, we define possible renovation measures and possible levels of renovation. Third, we identify and describe the uncertain parameters related to the production, replacement and dismantling of building elements as well as the operational energy use in LCCA and LCA. Afterwards, we carry out a robust multi-objective optimization to identify optimal renovation solutions. The results show that the replacement of the heating system in the building retrofit process is crucial to decrease the environmental impact. They also show that for a building with already good energy performance, the investments are not paid off by the operational savings. The optimal solution for the building with low energy performance includes the building envelope renovation in combination with the heating system replacement. For both buildings, the optimal robust cost-effective and climate-friendly solution is different from the deep renovation practice promoted to decrease the energy consumption of a building.  },

Therefore, visualisation of LCA results to support interpretation and decision-making becomes more important. The number of building LCA tools and the published literature has increased substantially in recent years. Most of them include some type of visualisation. However, there are currently no clear guidelines and no harmonised way of presenting LCA results. In this paper, we review the current state of the art in visualising LCA results to provide a structured overview. Furthermore, we discuss recent and potential future developments. The review results show a great variety in visualisation options. By matching them with common LCA goals we provide a structured basis for future developments. Case studies combining different kinds of visualisations within the design environment, interactive dashboards, and immersive technologies, such as virtual reality, show a big potential for facilitating the interpretation of LCA results and collaborative design processes. The overview and recommendations presented in this paper provide a basis for future development of intuitive and design-integrated visualisation of LCA results to support decision-making.  },

    year={2021},
    abstract={The use of timber and the implementation of the concept of circularity in the process of the construction of buildings potentially has a high sustainability impact, both from the perspective of material and construction technique. The three most effective ways to ensure the benefit of the circularity in the building sector in general are (1) maintain the service life of structures and buildings materials as long as possible to avoid unnecessary emissions and costs for demolition and reconstruction (2) conserve the quality of materials as long as possible to avoid unnecessary emissions and costs for the replacement and processing of new materials and (3) recycle and repurpose only the parts and materials which cannot function any more for technical and/or socio-cultural reasons. In this paper an approach is discussed towards a more sustainable built environment by making buildings adaptable to the changes of demands and requirements to building functions and thus leading to an extended use of buildings in a maximum of life cycles. This design for adaption may enhance economic, social and environmental benefits to various stakeholders and key players related to the building process, i.e. developers, building owners, users, municipality and others.  },

In the following paper, a comparative sustainability assessment of four building alternatives is presented. Especially the contribution of implementing Swiss timber versus the implementation of imported timber is highlighted. Additionally, the timber-hybrid building structures are compared to a pure reinforced concrete structure. The timber-hybrid structure, with Swiss timber, has clear ecological advantages with only half the greenhouse gas emissions and half the non-renewable energy consumption compared to the reinforced concrete alternative. Comparing the Swiss timber alternative to the imported timber alternative, there are clear ecological advantages, as well. In terms of economic and social sustainability assessment criteria, the reinforced concrete alternative has the lowest production costs and the lowest labor intensity (measured in terms of full-time equivalents). Additionally, the paper includes an analysis of biogenic CO2 emissions and CO2 storage within the timber building alternatives. Finally, an up-scaling to the national level is attempted, showcasing the ecological and economic advantages of promoting the use of locally produced timber.  },

The wearable device we used was the OURA ring which specializes in sleep monitoring. In general, the data quality showed good potential for the modelling phase. For the modelling phase, we had to make some choices, such as the programming language and the AI algorithm, that was the best fit for our project. First, it aims to make personal physiological data related studies more transparent. Secondly, the tenants will have a better sleep quality in their everyday life if they have an accurate prediction of the sleeping scores and ability to adjust the built environment.

    abstract={A top-down method for identifying product inputs to industries at product level is presented. The method employs routinely reported statistical data for industries, namely international trade data, which enables simple data acquisition and updates to databases with changes in the production processes. Two databases were developed that contain information for 103 industries and 1,264 product types based on a 13-year data time series. The first database shows frequency for a given product import by an industry; the second database shows the relative magnitude of product demand compared to the total amount of products imported by the industry. The frequency database depicts stability of a given product demand while the magnitude database identifies core products. The study was performed for Swedish imports. An upscaling evaluation was tested with Swedish exports and Portuguese imports data sets. It was found that industries have similar frequency of product demand, regardless of the country they are located in. Import magnitudes were found to have more dependence on the country for which data was collected. Nevertheless, when aggregated into major products groups, industrial product consumption is very similar in the two countries studied. One possible application of the databases developed in this study could be identification of new opportunities for industrial symbiosis among all industries operating in a region. Collated raw material inputs by industry are available in the databases, allowing industries which could potentially receive byproducts and wastes from elsewhere to be determined, without the need for direct contact between different actors.  },

    year={2021},
    abstract={Most digital tools developed for architects and urban planners cater to the environmental and economic dimensions of SD, leaving out the social dimension. SoSu as a dimension of SD lacks the analytical ability available to the economic and environmental dimensions in addressing the environmental and economic impacts of design decisions enabling a shorter feedback loop in the early design stage. In this paper, we implement a seven-step conceptual analysis methodology framework to explore (a) – the theoretical background of SoSu and (b) – to develop a user interaction model that can serve as a blueprint to develop digital tools to promote SoSu in the early stages of neighbourhood design. The theoretical background is developed in the first three steps – Mapping selected data sources, extensive reading and categorising selected data, and identifying and naming concepts. The model development further builds on the results of part (a) and involves deconstructing and categorising the concepts, integrating concepts and synthesis and re-synthesis of the concept. Finally, the seventh step consists of validating the conceptual framework through public discussion. We identify architects and urban planners as the target user group and the neighbourhood scale to apply SoSu concepts in the built environment and propose pre-requisites following a four-step user interaction model to develop digital tools to promote SoSu.  },

    abstract={Digital tools for performance-assessment are commonly used to shorten the feedback loop in testing designs for buildings and neighbourhoods. However, these tools do not extend to the social dimension in the same way as the economic and environmental dimensions. This paper aims to contribute to the development of digital tools to design socially sustainable neighbourhoods. We analyse 115 academic articles to establish a theoretical understanding of Social Sustainability (SoSu). Based on these results, we propose a digital user-interaction model to operationalise SoSu in the digital design process of buildings. In the literature, we observe a lack of consensus on the theoretical discussion on SoSu. Several extrinsic and intrinsic factors are identified contributing to this fuzziness; the dependency on stakeholder value systems, the qualitative nature of social indicators, and comparison to environmental sustainability being the most common. Still, we distinguish two overarching categories, social equity and social capital, that are further divided into sub-themes. Having mapped the categories and hierarchies of social themes, we propose a user-interaction model that incorporates these findings into a digital environment. The user-interaction model creates a guided decision-making framework for architects and urban planners by enabling stakeholders to make conscious and informed decisions grounded in theory.  },

    abstract={The purpose of the Spaces Project is to investigate glazed spaces in residential buildings from both a building physical and architectural point of view and to provide descriptions of how they work, with regard to thermal comfort and to social aspects. This has resulted in tools for the design of glazed spaces that take into account the social aspects and the thermal comfort. A challenge for the architect is to determine and describe the geometry of the glazed space, which materials make up the connecting surfaces and what properties the surrounding glass surfaces should have. With very little time, it is desirable in the design phase to get clear indications of temperature conditions in the glazed space, in particular how high the temperatures will become in summertime. The Spaces project began with a literature study on glazed spaces, dealing with geometry of the spaces, glazing, ​​usage, thermal comfort, ventilation, energy, social aspects and cultivation. Subsequently, eight relevant buildings were identified, called case studies, which were examined in detail during study visits and with the help of drawings and measurements of temperature and daylight. The buildings are located in Malmö, Eslöv, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Umeå and on Hönö. For all case studies, interviews have been conducted with residents and with professionals such as consultants, managers, architects, project managers, about the glazed space and how it works, mainly with regard to social sustainability but also technical functions. The residents have also responded to a survey and rated qualities in the areas of thermal comfort for different seasons, air quality, daylight, social activities and relaxation. With the help of the material from this part of the project, a checklist for the design of atriums has been produced which, for example, includes social activities, visibility, furnishability. In order to assess thermal comfort, an excel-based calculation tool, Spaces Calculator, for calculating temperatures in glazed spaces was created. The calculation model was designed so that architects, during the design stage, have access to a tool that is easy to start using, and where parameters can be varied quickly (e.g. geometries, glazing and materials), since in the design stage is desirable to be able to investigate many alternatives. The results from Spaces Calculator have been compared with results from the building simulation program IDA ICE, and user-friendliness has been tested by architects. Manual for Spaces Calculator and a number of examples of thermal variations when you change parameters for a building are produced. These examples show, for example, that a taller building reduces problems with overtemperatures in the summer, that heavier surface materials (with higher heat storage capacity) facing the glazed space dampen temperature fluctuations and how much a reduced g-value on skylights can reduce overtemperatures.   To sum up, there are four main outcomes of the Spaces project; the literature survey, the case studies with interviews, the calculation tool Spaces Calculator with parameter studies, and the design checklist.  },

    abstract={Environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) witnesses increasing popularity in the built environment. LCA stimulates among others an efficient use of natural resources and a reduction of carbon emissions through quantification of material and energy inputs and emissions in the building life cycle. Thereby, LCA aspires to contribute to SDG12 on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns. Despite high ambitions, the actual influence of LCA in construction projects is often modest. The mere application of LCA methodology in a building project is insufficient to produce a more environmentally friendly building. To better understand the practical conditions under which an LCA may induce change in a building project, we propose to analyse the use of LCA from a processual perspective. This paper presents a case study of a building product development project in which a processual perspective is applied on LCA. Using a longitudinal ethnographic methodology, key actors are followed through environmentally relevant episodes as the building project matures. A progressive LCA quantifies the potential environmental impact of the project as it progresses through different stages of the building process. Based on the learnings from this study, recommendations are presented to support the effective use of LCA in sustainable building practices, and contribute to SDG12 on sustainable consumption and production patterns.  },

    abstract={Purpose Within the field of life cycle assessment (LCA), simplifications are a response to the practical restrictions in the context of a study. In the 1990s, simplifications were part of a debate on streamlining within LCA. Since then, many studies have been published on simplifying LCA but with little attention to systematise the approaches available. Also, despite being pervasive during the making of LCA studies, simplifications remain often invisible in the final results. This paper therefore reviews the literature on simplification in LCA in order to systematise the approaches found today. Methods A review of the LCA simplification literature was conducted. The systematic search and selection process led to a sample of 166 publications. During the review phase, the conceptual contributions to the simplification discourse were evaluated. A dataset of 163 entries was created, listing the conceptual contributions to the simplification debate. An empirically grounded analysis led to the generative development of a systematisation of simplifications according to their underlying simplifying logic. Results and discussion Five simplifying logics were identified: exclusion, inventory data substitution, qualitative expert judgment, standardisation and automation. Together, these simplifying logics inform 13 simplification strategies. The identified logics represent approaches to handle the complexities of product systems and expectations of the users of LCA results with the resources available to the analyst. Each simplification strategy is discussed with regard to its main applications and challenges. Conclusions This paper provides a first systematisation of the different simplification logics frequently applied in LCA since the original streamlining discussion. The presented terminology can help making communication about simplification more explicit and transparent, thus important for the credibility of LCA. Despite the pervasiveness of simplification in LCA, there is a relative lack of research on simplification per se, making further research describing simplification as a practice and analysing simplifications methodologically desirable.  },

    abstract={Pitched wooden roofs are ventilated through an air cavity beneath the roofing in order to remove heat and moisture from the roof construction. The ventilation is driven by wind pressure and thermal buoyancy. This paper studies ventilation driven by thermal buoyancy in the air cavity of inclined roofs. The influence of air cavity design and roof inclination on the airflow is investigated. Laboratory measurements were carried out on an inclined full-scale roof model with an air cavity heated on one side in order to simulate solar radiation on a roof surface. Equipment to measure temperature was installed in the roof model, while air velocity in the cavity was determined by smoke tests. Combinations of different roof inclinations, air cavity heights and applied heating power on the air cavity top surface were examined. The study showed that increased air cavity height led to increased airflow and decreased surface temperatures in the air cavity. Increased roof inclination and heating power applied to the roofing also increased the airflow. The investigations imply that thermal buoyancy in the air cavity of pitched roofs could be a relevant driving force for cavity ventilation and important to consider when evaluating the heat and moisture performance of such a construction.  },

    abstract={In line with EU Directives, European building portfolio owners are required to bring their stock to nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) standards by 2050. To fulfil this goal in a timely and cost-effective manner, they will need to have a comprehensive understanding of their buildings’ condition, as well as consistent information on viable energy and low-carbon technology measures. Currently, in Europe, there is a lack of knowledge of what energy efficiency measures are being implemented in residential buildings. It is also unknown what are the decision-making processes behind the selection of these measures. On this basis, the aim of this study is to shed light on (1) what energy efficiency measures are currently carried out across European building portfolio owners (BPOs), (2) how are these measures selected (i.e. decisionmaking processes and information sources), and (3) what data would be needed to foster the uptake of low carbon energy efficiency technologies. The applied methodology combines desk research on scientific and grey literature, with findings in the field of building maintenance & operation. The later based on semi-structured interviews with 23 selected private and public BPOs across 7 European countries: Sweden, UK, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Results show that the most often implemented actions are the maintenance of the roof and the upgrade of the heating system. Measures are decided based on a combined planned and “reactive” (i.e. problem/solution) approach. The data that is typically used by BPOs is basic building information, such as gross floor area or year built. Although currently unavailable, the most often solicited evidence by the BPOS in favour of energy efficiency and low carbon technology measures is related to energy consumption and other user data.  },

    abstract={With regard to residential energy use in the European Union (EU), most studies consider potential adopters of the technology (e.g., private owners) as being the sole decision-makers in the technology selection. However, during an integrated decision-making process (e.g., a construction project) multiple stakeholders will interact, influencing each other's judgement, thereby making it difficult to discern who is affecting the final decision, and to what extent. The goal of this study is to outline the full network of stakeholders involved in the decision-making process, along with their degree of power and interaction in the technology choice. For this purpose, empirical evidence from a multi-country survey is examined using social network analysis (SNA). The information is compared across building typologies, project types and countries (i.e., Italy, Spain, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom, France, Belgium and the Netherlands). The results demonstrate that, in EU residential buildings, potential adopters of the technology are not the only stakeholders involved in the technology selection. They are in all instances in communication with multiple stakeholders, some of whom also hold a high level of power in the decision (i.e., key persuaders). Furthermore, their level of power and communication varies substantially across building typologies, project types and countries.  },

    abstract={Current studies and performance labels focus mainly on the operational energy demand of buildings due to heating, cooling, ventilation, lighting, and hot water, but they rarely account for embodied impacts. Performing a life cycle assessment (LCA) on an entire building structure, let alone a building, requires time and data, both of which are often lacking for practitioners in the construction industry. Limited knowledge on the embodied carbon equivalent of building structures led to the benchmarking effort of the database of embodied quantity outputs (DEQO), developed by the first author over the last 6 years in close collaboration with industry and academia. DEQO collects material quantities for existing buildings in a robust way directly from industry. This paper presents the lessons learned from this database to define the next steps for structural engineers to lower the environmental impacts related to the material quantities in their projects. To create confidence and comparability in the results, recommendations are given such as implementing uncertainty analysis into practice to avoid inaccurate comparisons with a false sense of precision.  },

    abstract={Purpose: This study aims to establish a regionalized environmental impact assessment of construction machinery equipped with diesel engines certified by the European emission standard Stage V, and operated in cold climatic zones in Europe. Method: The study quantifies potential environmental impacts associated with construction machinery over the entire lifecycle, from extraction of materials to the end-of-life. For the operation phase, a meso-level emission accounting method is applied to quantify tailpipe emissions for certain subcategories of construction machinery. This is achieved by determining the operational efficiency of each machine in terms of effective hours. The quantified emission data are then adjusted based on engine deterioration models to estimate the rate of increase in emissions throughout the lifetime of each machine. Finally, the CML impact assessment method is applied to inventory data to quantify potential environmental impacts. Results: The study shows that tailpipe emissions, which largely depend on an engine’s fuel consumption, had the largest contribution to environmental impacts in most impact categories. At the same time, there was a positive correlation between the operation weight and the impacts of the machinery. Also, machinery with similar operation weight had relatively similar impact patterns due to similar driving factors and dependencies. In addition, network, sensitivity, and uncertainty analyses were performed to quantify the source of impacts and validate the robustness of the study. Results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the responsiveness of the studied systems is very sensitive to changes in the amount of fuel consumption. In addition, the uncertainty results showed that the domain of uncertainty increased as the operation weight subcategory of machinery increased. Conclusion: This study extends previous work on the life cycle assessment (LCA) of construction machinery, and the methodology developed provides a basis for future extension and improvement in this field. The use of effective hours as the unit of operational efficiency helps to resolve uncertainties linked to lifetime and annual operation hours. Also, the obtained results can be of use for decision support and for assessing the impacts of transition from fossil fuels to alternative fuel types.  },

    title={Health and Office Architecture},
    year={2020},
    abstract={The office, where many people spend most of their day, influences the health of employees, their families, communities, and society. While the body of research that relates office environment to health is growing, a question of interest for practitioners arises: how buildings should be designed and managed in order to support and promote health. This thesis adopts a salutogenic perspective in physical office environments. The salutogenic approach is an orientation toward health that focuses on the origins of health rather than on the determinants of disease. Salutogenesis indicates that the factors that create health are often different from those that cause illness. In this perspective, ‘sense of coherence’ has been found to be a resource for health promotion. However, the previous research concerning health in offices has tended to focus on the negative impacts of physical office environments (pathogenic) and less research has been carried out on the components that create and maintain health (salutogenic). The research work included two literature reviews and a mixed-method case study approach. First, health and healthy offices are studied in the context of office design approaches to explore how health is understood in the literature. Additionally, the Nordic perspective is specifically studied as a complementary setting to gain a deeper understanding of healthy office conceptualizations. While the literature provides input from the scientific perspective, the case study approach was used to explore the sense of coherence theory in an architectural context. The findings first revealed that conceptualizations of health and healthy offices were not abundant, and most approaches were limited to a pathogenic perspective. Second, design strategies were often formulated with little consideration of contextual factors. That is, no holistic office design approach was found to address all design features and health aspects. Finally, from a sense of coherence perspective, manageability and meaningfulness were the most recurrently influenced components, mainly by a sense of control, ownership, and opportunities for social interactions. Comprehensibility was also influenced, nevertheless, largely by the lack of behavioral rules and clarity. Contextual factors, such as the organizational work culture, facility management style, individual preferences, and activities were critical to elucidate the findings. To conclude, the findings highlight the need for holistic approaches that go beyond the mitigation of pathogenic aspects and promote the salutogenic resources of the physical office environment in order to strengthen employees’ sense of coherence and empower them to more positively and adaptively deal with stressors. As such, the move toward the healthy continuum in office environments involves two complementary strategies. First, modifications can be made to the office aimed at alleviating risk factors (e.g., improving air quality) and second, maximizing the presence of salutogenic resources (e.g., optimizing a sense of control).  },

The overall goal is to facilitate the practical use and theoretical development of design approaches to healthy offices. Design/methodology/approach: A scoping review of 7,432 papers collected from 4 electronic databases and 5 scientific journals resulted in the selection of 18 papers for content analysis. Findings: Various ODAs relating to building design features and health were identified. The findings highlight challenges for this emergent field, including a paucity of literature on ODAs, a lack of definitions of health and healthy offices, ambiguous design strategies and a lack of a holistic ODA. Originality/value: ODAs are potentially valuable resources but an under-considered topic for healthy office development. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first scoping review to map and compare different design approaches in the context of office design and its main contribution is in encouraging researchers and practitioners to bring a salutogenic and holistic perspective to their design approaches.  },

Our intention is to raise broad issues drawing on multiple disciplines and provoke engagement with this area of underachievement. We ask: ● How do we achieve action and momentum in transformational change? ● What are the key components for future transformations in terms of governance, business models, time and sequencing, scaling, leadership and imagination? ● Are there limits and barriers to what can be achieved? ● Do these demands require a more radical and fundamental change and strategic direction? In responding we note the policy-action gap and the failure to recognise the complexity in policy responses, the continuing growth of cities and the ongoing inability to address basic health needs, and we speculate about the changes that affect the context in which we work over the next decade. We highlight two case studies, where we are involved, that attempt to close the implementation gap and progress transformations. We then offer some further reflections in relation to research and practice in attempting to transform cities and health together to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change, the implementation of the UN SDGs and actions on biodiversity. In discussion, we return to the current pandemic and what this tells us about this moment, future transformations and the possibilities and limits to action.  },

In this paper, three climate change scenarios are applied probabilistically for a renovation scenario using dimensionality reduction techniques and further uncertainty propagation. The results show that RCP2.6 provides more robust results and saves on average 2.10^5 CHF and 2.10^5kgCO2eq. in a building life cycle comparing to RCP 8.5. The analysis under climate change is also compared to the probabilistic calculations under current climate and the results show the underestimation of both costs and environmental impacts when climate change is not included. It can also be clearly seen that even under the best case of RCP 2.6, building renovation is urgently needed to decrease the environmental impacts and costs.  },

Selecting an appropriate renovation strategy is challenging due to the long building service life and consequent uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a new framework for the robust assessment of renovation strategies in terms of environmental and economic performance of the building's life cycle. First, we identify the possible renovation strategies and define the probability distributions for 74 uncertain parameters. Second, we create an integrated workflow for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost analysis (LCC) and make use of Sobol’ indices to identify a prioritization strategy for the renovation. Finally, the selected renovation scenario is assessed by metamodeling techniques to calculate its robustness. The results of three case studies of residential buildings from different construction periods show that the priority in renovation should be given to the heating system replacement, which is followed by the exterior wall insulation and windows. This result is not in agreement with common renovation practices and this discrepancy is discussed at the end of the paper.  },

    abstract={Residential buildings take a large share of the globally accumulated construction material stock. Knowledge regarding material stocks and flows and the spatial and temporal dynamics of residential structures is needed to enhance material circularity and, consequently, reduce the inflow of raw materials and the outflow of demolition waste. In this study, material stocks and flows in residential buildings are estimated with the aim of identifying spatiotemporal characteristics among different settlements. Sweden's 290 municipalities classified into eight settlement types are used as a case study. The modeling is realized bottom-up, with statistical inventory data and material intensity coefficients. The results demonstrate that, in the last 25 years, 63% of the residential material stock in Sweden has accumulated in the three largest metropolitan areas (Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö). In contrast, rural areas and the commuter municipalities to small cities show a decrease in material stocks. For the same period, particularities in material flows were also depicted. For instance, medium-size towns presented the highest inflow and outflow, commuter municipalities to large cities showed no outflow, and rural areas with a visiting industry had a high stock renewal. The material composition differs among settlements due to fluctuations in residential building type and age distribution of the stock. Brick and steel have higher stock in larger settlements, whereas wood and aggregate show higher stock in smaller, commuter and rural settlements. Spatially, it was observed that residential stock mainly accumulates in large cities located near the sea, and inland in medium-size towns along large transportation infrastructures such as high-speed roads that connect the large cities. These spatial observations indicate the formation of an intensively built human corridor, which can be used for enhancing material circularity within the national boundaries. The results point to spatial and temporal particularities in material stocks and flows among settlement types and, therefore, further related research is recommended. This study also contributes with an extensive discussion on drivers of stock accumulation, policy implications, uncertainties, and results validation.  },

Considering the growing market of multi-story wooden building in Sweden, CLT (cross laminated timber) structure with an alternative insulation composite with PIR insulation and MgO board was proposed. In order to prove the applicability of this construction for moisture safety, the hygrothermal performance of the wall was measured in real life at HSB Living Lab (Gothenburg, Sweden) throughout 2019. Furthermore, a numerical model to analyse its performance by transient heat and moisture transfer analysis was created to predict the performance of the wall system. After the successful validation of the numerical model, a parameter study was carried out to investigate the moisture risk of the wall system in the case of extensive wetting of the CLT panel and in various areas in Sweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm, Lund, Karlstad and Lule). The study showed a low mould growth risk either in the test at the living lab or in the feasibility study. The development of the technology should further focus on the cost-effectiveness and design of all the construction details for the future market application.  },

However, current tools for building LCA require detailed information not available in the decisive early design stages. As a result, LCA is usually applied as post-design evaluation and not used to improve the building design. The goal of this paper is to adapt the method of structured under-specified LCA to the Swiss context and implement it in a design-integrated tool. The users of the tool should be able to get a complete estimation of the life cycle impact based on very few inputs, such as building type, intended use and structural system. In addition, the tool should allow to replace these assumptions with more detailed information step by step throughout the design process. The paper describes the development of a structured database and a parametric tool. Furthermore, it exemplifies the intended workflow during the design process on a building design. The presented approach can be scaled up and adapted to the needs of other national contexts in the future. It facilitates environmental performance optimisation of buildings and supports making use of the big potential the building sector has regarding contributing towards climate action (UN SDG 13).  },

Various tools that use a BIM model for automatic quantity take-off as basis for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) have been developed recently. This paper describes the first application of such a BIM-LCA tool to evaluate the embodied global warming potential (GWP) throughout the whole design process of a real building. 34 states of the BIM model are analysed weekly. The results show that the embodied GWP during the design phase is twice as high as for the final building. These changes can be mainly attributed to the designers' approach of using placeholder materials that are refined later, besides other reasons. As such, the embodied GWP is highly overestimated and a BIM-based environmental assessment during the design process could be misleading and counterproductive. Finally, three alternatives to the established automatic quantity take-off are discussed for future developments.  },

Especially in the office environment, IEQ can influence work productivity positively. Within the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), goal 3 good health and well-being, and goal 8 decent work and economic growth are the two areas where IEQ can significantly contribute. To better design sustainable office buildings in line with the agenda 2030, the study aims to examine occupant satisfaction, health and work in a newly renovated office building which is labelled by the BREEAM certification scheme Silver. Occupant preferences of IEQ comparing to the current conditions were also explored to provide advice for future design. The results show that occupant satisfaction with IEQ has not well achieved and in the office environment occupants prefer warmer temperature, more fresh air, less noise, and more daylight. We also find that perceived IEQ is extensively related to occupant health and work productivity. It concludes that in such a newly renovated office building as a high-performance building, there are still many problems from the indoor environments. Therefore, improvements are needed to gain occupant satisfaction and positively influence occupant health, well-being and work productivity.  },

    abstract={Human health and well-being have gained growing attention in the societal debate as well as in research. It is widely acknowledged that employees’ health and well-being contribute to a decent work environment which can positively contribute to economic benefits for the employers, the social-welfare and health system as well as the building owners. However, the office environment is complex and constitutes of various factors affecting employees’ health and well-being, for example, indoor climate, architectural design, and social work environment. Therefore, this paper will focus on indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and workplace design, and their influence on employees’ health and work performance. A multi-disciplinary approach is developed integrating the subjective survey, semi-structured interview, and physical measurement for an in-depth investigation of the physical office environment and employees’ self-reported health and work performance. A large office building with BREEAM certification has been studied at the end of summer in 2019. In total, 160 employees were involved by an online-based survey and individual interview and workshop. The main aspects of IEQ were measured, including the thermal environment, air quality, acoustic and lighting. The correlations between IEQ and workspace design factors and 5-symptom based self-reported health and self-reported work performance concerning self-evaluation and leader’s feedback were studied. Results show that physical office environment shows a large association with self-reported health and self-reported work performance. IEQ factors of air quality and relative humidity are significantly correlated with PSI. Size of individual workspace and aesthetic appearance of the office gain the highest correlation with self-reported health status among the factors of workspace design. Noise and artificial lights are studied to be significantly associated with work performance, and distance between work desks is largely associated with work performance. Considering the needs of employees on the physical office environment, air temperature, air quality and availability to work concentrated still underperform but perceived as highly important by the employees. The study made efforts to study the complex factors existing in the office environment with a multi-disciplinary approach, which can be utilized in other case studies to evaluate office environment and identify the key factors. Thus, the study made it possible to review and compare the influence of physical environment factors affecting employees’ health and well-being. The data collected will contribute to an office database which is under development by the authors.  },

Among common construction materials, timber has a long tradition of numerous applications as a renewable material. The implementation of the concept of circularity in the process of the construction of timber buildings has a high potential sustainability impact. The concept of design for adaption is to extend the service life of timber building to the maximum in several life cycles. In this paper the demand regarding circularity is analysed from interviews with different stakeholders and their economic, social and environmental incentive. The possibility to assess the sustainability impact of design for adaption are evaluated.

The total area of PV plant was assumed to be 100 square meters. The simulations were carried out for modules installed on the roof and on the south-facing façade of a residential building. The comparison study is carried out to define the most suitable module type and brands for the considered place in the current study. The energy and economic performance of the grid-connected PV system are analyzed under the meteorological conditions of Padiham. The modules were characterized by evaluating their annual electrical energy generation and different figures of merit of the grid-connected PV systems such as the investment, annual profit, net present value, levelized cost of electricity, and the payback time. The simulations show that in this specific setup, monocrystalline modules have the best energy performance, while thin-film modules have the best economic performance.  },

    abstract={Ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems are using vertical ground heat exchangers, known as Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHEs), as a heat source or sink. The performance of the GSHP system strongly relies on the ground temperature surrounding the BHEs. This temperature depends on many parameters and varies during the operating time. Therefore, the determination of the ground temperature is crucial to define the design and the proper size of the BHEs so that the performance of the GSHP system can be kept at the desired level. The current study aims to formulate a complex structure of artificial neural network (ANN) model in a mathematical equation that expresses the change in the ground temperature around BHEs due to heat injection in the long run. To fulfill this aim, a numerical model of BHEs was created using the ANSYS (Analysis System) software to generate data. The generated data was then used to train the ANN model, which was built for this study. The simulation results show that the ANN model estimates the ground temperature (T-g) in the target GSHP system with higher accuracy.  },

    abstract={The global shift towards embodied carbon reduction in the building sector has indicated the need for a detailed analysis of environmental impacts across the whole lifecycle of buildings. The environmental impact of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems has rarely been studied in detail. Most of the published studies are based on assumptions and rule of thumb techniques. In this study, the requirements and methods to perform a detailed life cycle assessment (LCA) for HVAC systems based on building information modelling (BIM) are assessed and framed for the first time. The approach of linking external product data information to objects using visual programming language (VPL) is tested, and its benefits over the existing workflows are presented. The detailed BIM model of a newly built office building in Switzerland is used as a case study. In addition, detailed project documentation is used to ensure the plausibility of the calculated impact. The LCA results show that the embodied impact of the HVAC systems is three times higher than the targets provided by the Swiss Energy Efficiency Path (SIA 2040). Furthermore, it is shown that the embodied impact of HVAC systems lies in the range of 15–36% of the total embodied impact of office buildings. Nevertheless, further research and similar case studies are needed to provide a robust picture of the embodied environmental impact of HVAC systems. The results could contribute to setting stricter targets in line with the vision of decarbonization of the building sector.  },

    abstract={Buildings contribute 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions; therefore, strategies that can substantially reduce emissions from the building stock are key components of broader efforts to mitigate climate change and achieve sustainable development goals. Models that represent the energy use of the building stock at scale under various scenarios of technology deployment have become essential tools for the development and assessment of such strategies. Within the past decade, the capabilities of building stock energy models have improved considerably, while model transferability and sharing has increased. Given these advancements, a new scheme for classifying building stock energy models is needed to facilitate communication of modeling approaches and the handling of important model dimensions. In this article, we present a new building stock energy model classification framework that leverages international modeling expertise from the participants of the International Energy Agency's Annex 70 on Building Energy Epidemiology. Drawing from existing classification studies, we propose a multi-layer quadrant scheme that classifies modeling techniques by their design (top-down or bottom-up) and degree of transparency (black-box or white-box); hybrid techniques are also addressed. The quadrant scheme is unique from previous classification approaches in its non-hierarchical organization, coverage of and ability to incorporate emerging modeling techniques, and treatment of additional modeling dimensions. The new classification framework will be complemented by a reporting protocol and online registry of existing models as part of ongoing work in Annex 70 to increase the interpretability and utility of building stock energy models for energy policy making.  },

These goals require multifaceted action at municipal, regional, and national levels; however, there are limitations to calculating consumption at the regional and municipal levels. Consumption is dependent on the socioeconomic metabolism of the area, with its unique composition of industries, consumers, and public facilities, which may affect the most appropriate measures to meet goals effectively. In this study, we evaluated several methods to extrapolate municipality- and region-specific consumption from national-level data so that consumption estimates can be used to aid decision makers or make further analyses like environmental impact evaluation. We compared four approaches and validated our findings using reported consumption values as well as results from another model in use. We found that using per capita values for consumption is satisfactory for counties, but consumption in municipalities and metropolitan areas with populations smaller than 500,000 inhabitants was better described by one of the suggested methods on average.  },

    abstract={A discussion of sustainability in architecture cannot be meaningfully carried out without the inclusion of most buildings’ central purpose, namely the provision of indoor environments that are accommodating of occupants’ needs and requirements. To this end, building designers and operators are expected to demonstrate compliance with codes and standards pertaining to indoor environmental quality (IEQ). However, the majority of conventional IEQ standards, codes, and guidelines have a single-domain character, in that they address IEQ in terms of a number of isolated domains (i.e., thermal, visual, acoustic, air quality). In this context, the present contribution explores the current state of multi-domain IEQ evaluation approaches and the necessary conditions for their further development and application. Toward this end, a number of common building rating schemes were selected and analyzed in detail. The results of this assessment imply the necessity of both short-term improvements of the existing schemes in terms of the transparency and plausibility of the applied point allocation and weighting strategies and the fundamental need for a deeper empirically grounded understanding of the nature of occupants’ perception of and behavior in the built environments.  },

In many European countries, the building stock from this time needs to be renovated, and there are opportunities to introduce energy efficiency measures in the renovation process. information availability and increasingly available analysis tools make it possible to assess the impact of policy and regulation. This article describes methods developed for analyzing investments in renovation and energy performance based on building ownership and inhabitant socio-economic information developed for Swedish authorities, to be used for the Swedish national renovations strategy in 2019. This was done by analyzing measured energy usage and renovation investments made during the last 30 years, coupled with building specific official information of buildings and resident area characteristics, for multi-family dwellings in Gothenburg (N = 6319). The statistical analyses show that more costly renovations lead to decreasing energy usage for heating, but buildings that have been renovated during the last decades have a higher energy usage when accounting for current heating system, ownership, and resident socio-economic background. It is appropriate to include an affordability aspect in larger renovation projects since economically disadvantaged groups are over-represented in buildings with poorer energy performance.  },

    abstract={A bottom-up dynamic modeling framework aiming to incorporate realities of the decision-making process when implementing energy-saving building renovations is proposed and applied to a case study of all multifamily buildings in Gothenburg, Sweden. The developed model is based on real conditions of existing buildings, from the national Energy Performance Certificate database, building and property registers, and cadastral maps from the city planning office. Although explorative, the framework accounts for the reaction capacity in terms of (i) investments by all property owners and (ii) total workmanship capacity in the city. Two scenarios were considered to account for renovations driven solely by technical renovation needs (end-of-life of building components) and by cost efficiency; further, both scenarios were investigated at different levels of reaction capacity. The developed framework is easily replicable to other regions and cities. The retrofitting includes, as individual measures as well as in packages, increased insulation levels, increased efficiency of lighting and appliances, and the installation of heat recovery systems and photovoltaic panels. Whereas implementation of energy-efficient measures dictated solely by technical renovation needs led to a very low energy demand, with some buildings becoming energy producers by 2050, implementation strictly driven by cost-efficiency (from the perspective of the property owners) only reduced the energy demand by 5% during this time and would not fully utilize the investment capacity of the property owners. Furthermore, the current limitations of reaction capacity for the market shares allowed for a reduction of the energy demand by only 15% during the same period. Workmanship capacity was more constraining than investment capacity and is thus identified as a local imperative need and suggests cobenefits related to job creation within the construction sector.  },

    abstract={The building sector has a significant potential to reduce the material resource demand needed for construction and therefore, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Digitalization can help to make use of this potential and improve sustainability throughout the entire building's life cycle. One way to address this potential is through the integration of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) into the building process by employing Building Information Modeling (BIM). BIM can reduce the effort needed to carry out an LCA, and therefore, facilitate the integration into the building process. Areview of current industry practice and scientific literature shows that companies are lacking the incentive to apply LCA. If applied, there are two main approaches. Either the LCA is performed in a simplified way at the beginning of the building process using imprecise techniques, or it is done at the very end when all the needed information is available, but it is too late for decision-making. One reason for this is the lack of methods, workflows and tools to implement BIM-LCA integration over the whole building development. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to develop an integrated BIM-LCA method for the entire building process by relating it to an established workflow. To avoid an additional effort for practitioners, an existing structure for cost estimation in the Swiss context is used. The established method is implemented in a tool and used in a case study in Switzerland to test the approach. The results of this study show that LCA can be performed continuously in each building phase over the entire building process using existing Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques for cost estimation. The main benefit of this approach is that it simplifies the application of LCA in the building process and therefore gives incentives for companies to apply it. Moreover, the re-work caused by the need for re-entering data and the usage of many different software tools that characterize most of the current LCA practices is minimized. Furthermore, decision-making, both at the element and building levels, is supported.  },

    abstract={In light of the Swiss government's reduction targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under the Paris Agreement, this article investigates how and with which policy measures these reduction targets can be met for the Swiss residential building sector. The paper applies an agent-based building stock model to simulate the development of the Swiss residential building stock under three different policy scenarios. The scenario results until 2050 are compared against the reduction targets set by the Swiss government and with each other. The results indicate that while the current state of Swiss climate policy is effective in reducing energy demand and GHG emissions, it will not be enough to reach the ambitious emission-reduction targets. These targets can be reached only through an almost complete phase-out of fossil-fuel heating systems by 2050, which can be achieved through the introduction of further financial and/or regulatory measures. The results indicate that while financial measures such as an increase in the CO2 tax as well as subsidies are effective in speeding up the transition in the beginning, a complete phase-out of oil and gas by 2050 is reached only through additional regulatory measures such as a CO2 limit for new and existing buildings.  },

Bottom-up building stock models (BSMs) can be used to assess policy measures and strategies based on a quantitative assessment of energy demand and GHG emissions in the building stock over time. Recent developments in BSM-related research have focused on modeling the status quo of the stock and comparatively little focus has been given to improving the modeling methods in terms of stock dynamics. This paper presents a BSM based on an agent-based modeling approach (ABBSM) that models stock development in terms of new construction, retrofit and replacement by modeling individual decisions on the building level. The model was implemented for the residential building stock of Switzerland and results show that it can effectively reproduce the past development of the stock from 2000 to 2017 based on the changes in policy, energy prices, and costs. ABBSM improves on current modeling practice by accounting for heterogeneity in the building stock and its effect on uptake of retrofit and renewable heating systems and by incorporating both regulatory or financial policy measures as well as other driving and restricting factors (costs, energy prices).  },

This paper reviews 23 regions’ building energy codes and standards by first comparing their quantitative aspects and then analyzing their mandated rules and approaches. While the present paper focuses on offices, general recommendations are applicable to other building types as well. The review revealed a wide range of occupant-related values, approaches, and attitudes. For example, code-specified occupant density varies by nearly a factor of three between different codes. This underlines the need for development of advancement in occupant behavior modeling approaches for future occupant-centric building performance codes and standards. Moreover, occupants are often referred to only implicitly; underlying expectations about energy-saving occupant behavior from building occupants varies greatly; and, only a few codes address occupant feedback and system usability. Based on the findings of the review, a set of initial recommendations for future building energy codes is proposed.  },

The method employs routinely reported statistical data for economic activities, which enables simple data acquisition and ensures capture of changes in production processes and waste generation. Quantified waste generation profiles following the EWC-stat nomenclature for 42 waste types were compiled into two EU databases, one for 12 sectors and the other for more than 200 industries. These were complimented with quantified factors on waste generation per employee for each sector. The relationship between amounts of waste generated and number of employees has been confirmed for each sector with statistical tests; this can be used to estimate waste quantities in other scenarios. The databases employ standard EU economic and waste nomenclatures, which are also similar to those used worldwide. Potential use scenarios include: evaluation of different geographic boundaries, such as industrial park, municipal, regional or national level; focus on expected types and quantities of waste generated by particular sectors and industries; or targeting particular types of wastes, the economic activities that produce them and the quantities generated. The latter scenario is illustrated in this paper by exploring potential for industrial symbiosis where waste streams from bio-based industries are used to produce biogas in the Västra Götaland region of Sweden. The developed method and databases could support the implementation of circular economy policies, including industrial symbiosis.  },

Two fundamental differences lie in the targeted life cycle stages and stakeholders. UNEP/SETAC guidelines for S-LCA tend to be dominant in the “production” stage, whereas, GBCS and EN 16309 focus predominantly on the “use” stage of the lifecycle. GBCS and EN 16309 methodologies focus on the “consumer” (building occupant) and “local community” stakeholders. Extending the scope of the rating systems across more stakeholders and life cycle stages to include S-LCA subcategories could lead to greater awareness and application of the S-LCA concept in the building and construction sector.  },

However, these digital tools focus on the economic and environmental dimensions and do not extend to the social dimension in the same way. Our research aims to develop digital tools to integrate Social Sustainability in the digital design process on the neighbourhood level. In this project, we evaluate academic literature on Social Sustainability through Conceptual framework analysis. First, we map the data sources and categorize them. Second, we identify and name the concepts found in the search. Third, we deconstruct and re-categorize the concepts. Finally, we integrate the concepts to form the theoretical basis of our solution. We find that the contributing factors that create contention in discussing social sustainability are both intrinsic and extrinsic to Social Sustainability. There is a disconnect between the theory and policy recommendations of social sustainability in the built environment. The practical challenges for the development of a digital design tool are primarily in resolving differences in stakeholder value systems and subsequently the priorities of social issues to stakeholders, and the technical issues we observe are on the quantification of qualitative indicators of social sustainability and availability of data. Drawing from these results, we propose guidelines for the development of digital tools for architects and planners working to promote social sustainability on a neighbourhood scale.  },

The lack of a proper long-term plan can lead to financial difficulties, especially in older buildings where the components are old and in need of extensive maintenance and renovation. These difficulties are complex and more pronounced in less-attractive markets where maintenance and renovation budgets are limited and socioeconomic issues are prevalent. In order to address the complexity of the problem and fully utilize the potential value in buildings, multiobjective analyses of maintenance and renovation plans need to be carried out together with proper life expectancy analyses. Current planning methods are not flexible or efficient enough to combine life expectancy analyses with multiobjective optimization processes. This paper presents a maintenance and renovation scheduling method that utilizes a modified deterioration function for life expectancy analyses and combines it with a service life-cycle cost analysis to facilitate multiobjective optimization processes. To demonstrate its application, the proposed method is used for maintenance and renovation planning for two identical buildings of different ages. To further demonstrate its economic benefits, the proposed method is used for planning under a restricting annual budget constraint and the results are compared to the results from a conventional method used by the managing company. The proposed planning method helps decision makers choose maintenance and renovation strategies in difficult market situations and/or under budget constraints.  },

    abstract={Introduction: The application of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique to a building requires the collection and organization of a large amount of data over its life cycle. The systematic decomposition method can be used to classify building components, elements and materials, overcome specific difficulties that are encountered when attempting to complete the life cycle inventory and increase the reliability and transparency of results. In this paper, which was developed in the context of the research project IEA EBC Annex 72, we demonstrate the implications of taking such approach and describe the results of a comparison among different national standards/guidelines that are used to conduct LCA for building decomposition. Methods: We initially identified the main characteristics of the standards/guidelines used by Annex participant countries. The “be2226” reference office building was used as a reference to apply the different national standards/guidelines related to building decomposition. It served as a basis of comparison, allowing us to identify the implications of using different systems/standards in the LCA practice, in terms of how these differences affect the LCI structures, LCA databases and the methods used to communicate results. We also analyzed the implications of integrating these standards/guidelines into Building Information Modelling (BIM) to support LCA. Results: Twelve national classification systems/ standards/guidelines for the building decomposition were compared. Differences were identified among the levels of decomposition and grouping principles, as well as the consequences of these differences that were related to the LCI organization. In addition, differences were observed among the LCA databases and the structures of the results. Conclusions: The findings of this study summarize and provide an overview of the most relevant aspects of using a standardized building decomposition structure to conduct LCA. Recommendations are formulated on the basis of these findings.  },

    abstract={Purpose: Winter road maintenance in the Nordic climate is demanding due to challenging weather conditions, high precipitation, and icy conditions. As a leading country in the transition to low-emission transport, Norway must work to reduce their emissions while providing a safe level of service through winter maintenance operations. This article investigates the environmental impacts of winter road maintenance (WRM) in Norway both today and under a climate change scenario predicted for 2050. Methods: Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental impact of the functional unit “average winter road maintenance in Norway on national and county roads per km.lane.” The ReCiPe (hierarchy) method was used to identify and categorize emissions related to WRM to show how different factors affect the system and to reveal hidden emissions hotspots. Real-time data from WRM vehicles were used to determine how fuel consumption is affected by gradient and weather. Producers and operators provided other relevant information on WRM vehicles. Official reports supplied information on deicer quantities used and the total distance driven by WRM vehicles in Norway. Results and discussion: The quantity of deicer used is the main source of emissions contributing toward all impact categories. The effect of deicer is likely to be even higher in certain impact categories. The environmental impact of the deicer after application is not included. The representation of WRM in existing emissions data is limited despite the considerable amount of deicer applied and the long distances that WRM vehicles travel. The results document how energy use throughout the system is another important source of emissions. Various parameters, such as road gradient, vehicle properties, driver behavior, and weather, affect the fuel consumption of WRM vehicles, with weather being the most important of these. Conclusions: Significant potential for emissions reductions from WRM was found, and WRM operations should be included in cold-climate road LCA studies. The environmental impacts of deicer application are especially high compared to the mechanical clearing of roads and contribute strongly to impact categories such as terrestrial, freshwater, and human toxicity and to the formation of particulate matter.  },

    abstract={The project investigates glazed geometries in residential buildings as a robust solution from a health and resource perspective (primarily energy and cultivation). Our hypothesis is that that glazed geometries, with a more adapted volume, can increase well-being and social interaction without increased energy use. The studied geometries are primarily spaces for communication and leisure in residential buildings, consisting of wind protected glazed areas such as atria, entrances and stairways. Furthermore, these geometries may have varying indoor climate that is governed mainly by the building itself and residents, rather than by building services. The project will contribute with examples of new well-performing geometries and usage (such as larger entrances with social areas), and methods to evaluate the performance early in the design process (with respect to indoor environmental quality and energy efficiency) and to provide guidance for architectural design and increased social interaction. In the initial stage of the project, examples of glazed geometries at buildings have been identified and inventories at these buildings have been performed to gather relevant data from the design phase (e.g. building permits and interviews with consultants), to the use phase (e.g. interviews with users and maintenance staff) and follow up (e.g. energy performance certificates). At the initial stage, the users are the most important people to interview since they provide information on the key aspects of the project, i.e. wellbeing in the spaces. This includes thermal comfort, acoustics, indoor air quality and, in particular social interaction and usage of spaces.  },

    year={2020},
    abstract={This report of the International Energy Agency (IEA) Annex 65 subtask 4 considers a few selected but relevant means of assessing the current sustainability performance of Super-Insulating Materials (SIMs) namely the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the Life Cycle Cost calculation (LCC), and the Embodied Energy (EE). Subtask 4 of IEA Annex 65 investigated the existing studies on LCA on super insulation materials (SIMs), according to the product categorization agreed by the Annex. After mapping the current state, the subtask constructed a life cycle inventory (LCI) of SIMs to make a transparent assessment of the environmental performance of a range of SIMs. Based on this LCI, a life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) of SIMs was also conducted. Contribution analysis was conducted to highlight the hotspots of the environmental performance of SIMs and a comparison between the conventional thermal insulation materials is shown. The SIMs examined in IEA Annex 65 are advanced porous materials (APMs) and vacuum insulation panels (VIPs). The original approach of this subtask was to construct this transparent LCI through cooperation with the manufacturers. However, this approach was unable to be implemented due to various challenges including resolving concerns over confidentiality issues. This led the subtask to develop the LCI based on the existing literature. The LCIA of VIP showed a good level of coherency with the published Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs), which normally does not contain transparent LCI information. The result creates a solid basis for the comparison with conventional insulation materials for other LCIA studies. Meanwhile, the LCIA result of aerogel (the APM examined) showed a large difference between published EPDs. This was due to the fact that the available LCI information only represented the pilot scale. Although EPDs represent product-specific LCIA results, the level of information described in the document may not always be sufficient to allow a fair comparison. This lack of transparency remains a challenge for new advanced materials. A hypothetical case of renovation which looked into the economic and the environmental payback time showed that SIMs have very long simple payback times in most northern European cities. However, places with high land price or high heating demand can affect the competitiveness of the SIMs, both economically and environmentally. In reality, there are various limitations that may affect the decision of insulation material selection. Cases where space limitations are given, or preservation of the architectural design were seen as reasons for implementing the SIMs in the existing building renovation projects.  },

    abstract={Interventions targeted at district-level are a potentially effective way to reduce consumption-based urban impacts; however, a systematic method for accounting these impacts at district scale has not yet been developed. This article outlines a method for transforming household expenditure data into consumption quantified on a physical basis. Data sources are combined to calculate monetary value per unit mass for different products consumed by households. Socio-economic household archetypes are selected, and typical consumption for these archetypes is calculated by combining expenditure data from a household budget survey with the calculated monetary values per unit mass. The resulting physical quantities of different products consumed are envisaged as an essential part of performing district scale material flow analysis and urban metabolism studies, also as an input for assessing consumption-based environmental impacts and for designing sustainable consumption policies. The method was applied to characterise consumption in urban districts. The obtained results were used to assess of districts' consumption-based impacts with life cycle assessment (LCA) and to inform design of sharing economy. The method was found to be an effective way to evaluate the demand for products in different districts; this in turn could inform objective measures to aid more sustainable urban consumption.  },

    title={Simplifying LCA use in the life cycle of residential buildings in Sweden},
    year={2019},
    abstract={This thesis discusses the use of environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) in the building life cycle. While the life cycle of a residential building is an important source of environmental concern, knowledge about LCA remains scarce and sporadic in most construction companies. In anticipation of a regulatory requirement for LCA-based climate declarations, construction companies in Sweden are expressing increasing interest in applying LCA to residential buildings. However, despite this interest, many companies experience difficulties making effective use of the potential that LCA may have to shape environmental action in the building process. The aim of this licentiate is to clarify the conditions that hinder a more effective use of LCA. It addresses whether LCA is too complex to be used effectively, and whether there are other conditions that may require attention. In addition, it examines whether simplification of LCA may be a meaningful way to stimulate LCA use in the building life cycle. A literature-based exploration of LCA use in the building context was conducted. The results of this exploration identify central problems with LCA use for residential buildings and focus specifically on the complexity of building LCA. In addition, this licentiate provides an empirically informed account of the experiences and perceived problems with residential building LCA in Swedish construction companies. Perceptions of LCA analysts and environmental managers were explored in an interview-based study. In addition, nine LCA studies were conducted on multifamily residential buildings using data from these construction companies. The findings in this licentiate indicate that while complexity should not be discounted, it cannot explain the ineffective use of LCA in the building life cycle. Even if LCA may be difficult to understand, the types of complexity involved are not essentially different from those tackled successfully elsewhere in the building process. In addition, there are several other reasons that explain why LCA is considered difficult to use. Problems with demand, resources, data availability, and competence all contribute to an environment in which performing LCA is more difficult than necessary. A review of available LCA simplification strategies is presented to tackle complexity in building LCA. A systematic search and review was conducted using the simplification literature. The results suggest a wide variety of established simplification techniques, following five central simplifying logics: exclusion, data-substitution, expert judgement, standardisation, and automation. These simplification strategies can be used to more easily apply LCA in a building context. In 2022, the use of LCA-based climate declarations will become a state requirement in the Swedish building sector. In order to make more effective use of LCA in the building life cycle, it is not enough to merely apply LCA to calculate the greenhouse gas emission of a finished building design. If the ambition is to make use of the full potential of LCA for industry and ecology, it is necessary to more actively integrate LCA in the planning, design, and construction of residential buildings.  },

The goal is to discover what constitutes the main priorities for road planners, how these priorities are ranked when it comes to alignment selection, and how they are related to guiding factors identified in official planning documents and government transport plans throughout the life cycle of a road. This is done through a comprehensive literature and data search, involving published academic research in the road alignment design field, and by exploring Norwegian road planning documents and guidelines. Examples from a recently implemented road project are also included as a way to illustrate alignment priorities in theory versus how alignment decisions are made in practice. Particular attention is paid to how key factors influence environmental and social dimensions and how much importance these dimensions are given in the overall decision-making process. The focus on the Norwegian case is relevant in that it will identify which knowledge gaps need to be filled based on actual practices in the Norwegian road sector. The results of this study found that the dominating factors in road planning and alignment selection are the user cost and the environmental and socio-economic as they are directly related to the main national transport strategy of developing a carbon-neutral and resilient transport system. These results can be used to reinforce and amplify existing road planning strategies and to understand where challenges for environmental and social responsible road planning and alignment selection are found.  },

However, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the literature on the diffusion of energy efficiency technologies is still missing. We conducted a bibliometric analysis to better understand the knowledge base in the field energy efficiency technology diffusion in the European residential building stock. After the scanning and screening process, we identified 954 scientific articles pertinent to this topic. Through a co-citation network analysis, we generated a visual knowledge structure of the field and by the further investigation of the bibliography we were able to synthesize the state-of-the-art and answer to our initial research questions. Results of the co-citation network show a scattered and fragmented field in many domains. The descriptive analysis highlights this fragmentation, especially on a cross-country level among EU country members. Findings from this study contribute to map the scientific knowledge base in relation to technology diffusion in European residential building projects, identify relevant topic areas, visualize the links between the topics, as well as to recognize research gaps and opportunities. The methodology utilized in this paper proved to be viable approach to map and characterize the knowledge base within a field and can, therefore, be replicated in upcoming studies with analogous ambitions.  },

This study used spatial road data from Norway followed by integrating temporal-spatial and statistical analyses to show a potential approach to estimate the lifetimes of asphalt surfacing. For the statistical part, a stratified Cox proportional hazard model was used to understand the relationship between longevity of surface mixtures and different factors, while avoiding having predefined assumptions rooted in deterministic modeling. In addition, rutting was used as the response variable to determine distress-specific asphalt surfacing lifetimes and to handle censored data. Inclusion of rutting as the response variable showed that the median technical lifetime of asphalt surfacing is about 2 years shorter than that of the maintenance activity records. The results showed the significance of each covariate; however, aggregate nominal maximum size and heavy traffic volume were consistently the significant covariates across the studied traffic classes. In addition, the results were fitted to reference categories in each covariate to show a practical approach to interpret absolute values of lifetimes from a survival table.  },

    abstract={Point Daylight Factor (DFP) has been used for daylighting design in Sweden for more than 40 years. Progressive densification of urban environments, in combination with stricter regulations on energy performance and indoor environmental quality of buildings, creates complex daylight design challenges that cannot be adequately solved with DFP. To support a development of the current and future daylight indicators in the Swedish context, the authors have developed a comprehensive methodology for the evaluation of daylight levels in existing buildings. The methodology comprises sample buildings of various use and their digital replicas in 3D, detailed numerical simulations and correlations of diverse DF metrics in existing buildings, a field investigation on residents' satisfaction with available daylight levels in their homes, and a comparison between the numerical and experimental data. The study was deliberately limited to the evaluation of DF metrics for their intuitive understanding and easy evaluation in real design projects. The sample buildings represent typical architectural styles and building technologies between 1887 and 2013 in Gothenburg and include eight residential buildings, two office buildings, two schools, two student apartment buildings, and two hospitals. Although the simulated DFP is 1.4% on average, i.e., above the required 1%, large variations have been found between the studied 1200 rooms. The empirical data generally support the findings from the numerical simulations, but also bring unique insights in the residences' preferences for rooms with good daylight. The most remarkable result is related to kitchens, typically the spaces with the lowest DF values, based on simulations, while the residents wish them to be the spaces with the most daylight. Finally, the work introduces a new DF metric, denoted DFW, which allows daylighting design in early stages when only limited data on the building shape and windows' arrangement are available.  },

    abstract={Aim: This article explores emerging design approaches in relation to health in the context of office building design. Background: Design for health is an emergent theme in architectural design. Healthcare sector has long dealt with the built environment and its health outcomes. In the past decades, there has been growing interest in the potential of design approaches with a key focus on patients’ health such as Co-design, Evidence-based design, Salutogenic design, User-centred design. Some of these approaches extend beyond healthcare to sectors such as schools and offices. Nevertheless, very little is currently known about how these design approaches relate to employee health and wellbeing in office building design. Therefore, new insights into the existing literature is needed to support discussions on future office design among researchers. Methods: A scoping review of 7432 papers was conducted in 2018, in four electronic databases and five scientific journals to scan design approaches in relation to health and wellbeing in office building design resulting in the selection of 26 papers. Result: The review, firstly, disclosed a mismatch between the research outputs and target population. Secondly, a limited understanding of health in relation to office physical environment was noted. Lastly, design approaches were found to be underdeveloped in the field of office design. Conclusion: It was noted that Salutogenic orientation toward health is not well-recognized in work environments. Further research might be useful to conceptualize positive aspects of health in relation to physical office environment. Design for health is becoming more visible in office context, however, more research is required to expand our thinking toward the impact of the interplay of design aspects on those health and wellbeing related outcomes. This might be through firstly identifying the dimensions of office environments that can support employee well-being, and, secondly, testing and validating existing frameworks. Considering the different cultural norms for dissemination, with research agenda focusing on scholarly communication, against a far more visual language used by designers, we need to identify ways to increase visibility and readability of research outputs  },

Background : The Nordic countries have a worldwide fame for their high living and working standards. Nevertheless, they have also been facing global challenges related to demographic changes, aging population, and a rise in long term conditions which require a creative way of thinking, and innovative approaches in the ways we deliver buildings and the built environment. The built environment is a health determinant and a resource for health and wellbeing of building users. In office sector, however, there is little known regarding the design implications of the physical environment for health outcomes. A review of the literature on the current state of the art in the Nordic context could offer an opportunity to rethink office design and support dialogue on how better design can improve employee health outcomes. Methods : An explorative document analysis of recent literature on workplace environment in the Nordic context was carried out. Results : Three main gaps in the literature were identified, including (1) limited understanding of health, (2) unrecognised role of the physical work environment and design professions in relation to health, and (3) diverse research orientations. The combination of results suggests the paucity of the studies relating the physical office environment to positive health approaches. Conclusions : This review highlights the need for more quantitative and qualitative methods to give relevant knowledge for complex questions regarding the physical office environment and health outcomes of employees. Future research should enable dialogue and collaboration between different actors such as managers, human resources, occupational health professionals and designers, which can benefit the users of office building.  },

The MS is estimated bottom-up with (a) material-intensity coefficients and (b) spatial data for three built environment components: buildings, road transportation, and pipes, using sevenmaterial categories. The city of Gothenburg, Sweden is used as a case study. Moreover, being the first case study in Northern Europe, the results are explored through various aspects (material composition, age distribution, material density), and, finally, contrasted on a per capita basis with other studies worldwide. The stock is estimated at circa 84 million metric tons. Buildings account for 73% of the stock, road transport 26%, and pipes 1%. Mineral-binding materials take the largest share of the stock, followed by aggregates, brick, asphalt, steel, and wood. Per capita, the MS is estimated at 153 metric tons; 62 metric tons are residential, which, in an international context, is a medium estimate. Denser neighborhoodswith a mix of nonresidential and residential buildings have a lower proportion of MS in roads and pipes than low-density single-family residential neighborhoods. Furthermore, single-family residential neighborhoods cluster in mixed-age classes and show the largest content of wood. Multifamily buildings cluster in three distinct age classes, and each represent a specific material composition of brick, mineral binding, and steel. Future work should focus on megacities and contrasting multiple urban areas and, methodologically, should concentrate on algorithms,MS indicators, and spatial divisions of urban stock.  },

    abstract={Various environmental and regulatory changes, such as climate change mitigation strategies and market regulation, have increased the complexity of the challenges which cities, utilities, and real estate owners face. Thus, cities and their utilities are confronted with various problems: How, and at which costs can ambitious climate change mitigation goals be reached? How can urban planning be developed while simultaneously tackling climate change? How can the long-term economic and environmental performance of the building stock be optimized? How to plan electricity, gas, and thermal networks to suit future energy demand and the existing urban topology? These problems are usually addressed individually and independently from each other using instruments that lack an interdisciplinary approach. Data collections are often done “ad hoc” and not from a systemic point of view, resulting in datasets that are often incomplete, incoherent, and with different structures that make them difficult to merge. The paper describes the Carbon Resource Energy and Adaption Toolbox Europe (CREATE), a comprehensive modelling and data toolbox that can overcome these shortcomings. This toolbox has been developed to include elements that are specially conceived for various use cases of different decision makers (and their service providers): urban planners, energy utilities, network operators, building portfolio owners, building code designers, construction authorities, energy and climate policy makers. CREATE has three main elements: • Expert BSM: GIS-based scenario analysis tool for urban and utility energy planners, providing evaluation and management of energy demand, emissions, renewable energy resources, and other parameters. • Basic Web BSM: Simplified web-based spatial data information, monitoring and visualization tool for smaller municipalities and utilities. • Portfolio BSM: A portfolio assessment tool for real estate portfolio owners and manager to analyse the status quo of their portfolio and the possibility to develop short- and long-term strategies in terms of economic, energy and carbon performance. As such CREATE enables engagement between the various decision-making levels and bodies of cities and municipalities as well as (energy) utilities and building portfolio owners or real estate site developers.  },

    abstract={Users have significant impacts on building energy consumption and can interact with indoor environments. Identifying user needs, behaviour, and preference is crucial for the design of both new and the renovation of existing buildings. Offices are important since people spend on average one-third of their life at work. It also accounted for a larger share of the energy use and the floor area of non-residential buildings in Europe. Moreover, more ambitious regulations and the increasing popularity of voluntary building certification schemes require the construction of more energy-efficient buildings, but in reality, a ‘performance gap’ is often observed. Therefore, deep insights in user perceptions and experiences can provide the knowledge basis for developing a new generation of office buildings that provide a healthier and more productive indoor environment guided by a user-centric approach. In  his article, we will introduce the web-based application of the Questionnaire and Diary Apps and a Virtual Reality (VR) design tool developed to support the interactive co-creation session with users and designers.  },

    abstract={© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. The current work investigates how adding a battery of optimal capacity to a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system can improve its economic feasibility. Also, the effect of different parameters on the feasibility of the PV system was evaluated. The optimal battery capacity (OBC) was determined for different saving targets of the annual electricity consumption of the chosen building. For this aim, real electricity consumption data of a residential building in Landskrona, Sweden, was used as energy consumption profile. A Solar World SW325XL, which is a monocrystalline solar panel, was selected as PV panel. The calculations were performed under the metrological and economic conditions of southern Sweden. Different working parameters (WPs) were considered (prices of the battery, feed-in tariffs, and saving targets). The performed calculations show that the optimal battery capacity (OBC), in which the payback time (PBT) of the system is maximized, strongly depends on the WP. The proper selection of the battery can considerably increase the economic feasibility of the PV system in southern Sweden. However, in some cases, using battery can have a negative impact on the PBT of the system. The results show that the electricity price, the module price, the inverter price, and the inverter lifetime have the highest effect on the PBT.  },

    abstract={Renovating the existing building stock has a significant potential to achieve the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the European Union. However, a common European renovation project focuses primarily on improving the thermal performance of the building shell by adding insulation to the opaque surfaces and improve the thermal performance of the windows. The potentially positive contribution of renewable energies (RE) in balance with energy efficiency measures is often underestimated. Consequently, a more holistic approach can contribute to a reduction in total net energy demand up to 40-45% for the entire buildings sector. Thus, in order to achieve the goal of GHG emission reduction in an economic most responsible way, the share of RE in a renovation project needs to be increased. However, building renovation projects are becoming - apparently - more complicated if more factors are considered in the planning of a renovation project. Thus, a computational tool for evaluating hundreds of different renovation options, including the implementations of renewable energy resources, to obtain an optimal or nearly optimal set of renovation options is essential. Therefore, a novel planning tool has been developed within the framework of DREEAM project, a project funded by the European Union within the Horizon 2020 research framework. The DREEAM-Tool has been designed in the way that it helps designers and other stakeholders to plan a renovation project of a single building or even on a multi-building scale. The tool was built in the way to optimize the renovation project taking into consideration the most critical factors in planning and decision-making processes, such as the economic or environmental performance. In other words, the tool combines an energy calculation model for a building or multiple building with an economic and environmental assessment to identify and optimize the most beneficial refurbishment solutions. The current study presents the concept of the DREEAM-Tool and shows examples of how the optimal renovation packages of a considered building will be determined and how this will support designers or buildings owners in decision-making processes.  },

    abstract={Understanding the global environmental impacts of local consumption is an area of growing interest among policymakers and consumers. By knowing what products comprise urban consumption “hotspots,” municipalities and consumers alike could take deliberate actions to target and discourage consumption of high-impact products. In this paper, a new method for identifying environmental hotspots of consumption is presented. The main methodological advances are the following: i) material flow analysis of urban areas and life cycle assessment are combined; ii) a 16-year time-series of urban consumption data is used for selection of the most suitable representative products and for trend analysis; iii) representative products are selected systematically from consumption data of 1000 product types; iv) representative products are scaled up to represent consumption of the product groups; v) hotspots are identified by simultaneously evaluating six environmental impacts - acidification, climate change, eutrophication (marine and freshwater), photochemical ozone formation, and resource use; vi) for the case study, hotspots are connected to the city's profiles. The method was applied to the Swedish cities Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo and to Sweden in total. Electronics is a hotspot for all the studied areas and all the studied impacts and should be a prioritized product group for action. Fuel is a hotspot shared by all the areas while vehicles is a hotspot in Gothenburg. Meat is a nationwide hotspot, but not for the cities investigated. Gothenburg and Stockholm could collaborate to find effective measures for their common hotspot machinery. Thus, the method can be used to identify hotspots and find which product types could be part of national versus local programs.  },

    abstract={Decision makers are tasked with defining and implementing measures that can meet established environmental targets. However, it is not always clear how effective the measure(s) will be in meeting the specified goals and which measures should be prioritized for implementation. To fill this gap, we have developed a method for testing planned actions to estimate potential impact on targets. The method can be performed at any scale, e.g., at the national, regional, or city level. The approach considers several factors, including the total consumption of an area, region-specific consumption-based environmental hotspots, the decision makers, the reduction targets and related measures, as well as multiple impact types. We present the method using the example of the municipality Gothenburg, Sweden. In collaboration with local authorities in Gothenburg, we co-created scenarios that bundle proposed measures intended to make progress towards their climate target of 3.5 tons carbon dioxide equivalents per capita. We then quantified how measures related to two known environmental hotspots, fuel and electronics, may affect climate change impact levels by the target year of 2035. The scenarios indicate that despite targeting known high-impact product types in Gothenburg, the efforts lead to only 14% of the reduction needed to meet the specified goal.  },

    abstract={© 2019 The Authors Residential buildings account for almost a quarter of the total energy use in Sweden and building owners are, therefore, under pressure from policy makers to improve the energy performance of their buildings. Building portfolio owners (BPOs) generally face multiple barriers in energy efficiency investments such as financial constraints and lack of knowledge of the current state when planning energy efficiency measures. This paper presents a method for cost-optimal scheduling of maintenance and retrofit measures on a portfolio level by drawing on research on building stock modeling and maintenance retrofit planning. The method uses a building stock modeling approach to model costs, energy and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)of a building portfolio and combines this with a method for optimal maintenance and retrofit scheduling in order to forecast and optimize the timing of measures on a building portfolio level. This enables the integrated long-term planning on retrofit investments and reduction of energy demand and GHG emissions for a portfolio of existing buildings. The application to the building portfolio of the municipal housing company of Gothenburg showed that by optimizing the maintenance and retrofit plans, ambitious retrofit measures can be introduced in the majority of the buildings with a positive effect on the service-life cycle costs. Moreover, the method is easily transferable to other building portfolios in Sweden as it builds up on nationally available data sets but is ideally complemented and verified using inspection data and existing maintenance plans of the BPOs in future applications.  },

    year={2019},
    abstract={In Europe, residential and commercial buildings are directly and indirectly responsible for approximately 30–40% of the overall energy demand and emitted greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A large share of these buildings was erected before minimum energy-efficiency standards were implemented and are therefore not energy- or carbon-efficient. Consequently, buildings offer significant potential in terms of energy efficiency and the reduction of GHG emissions compared to the status quo. To make use of this potential at scale, targeted policy measures and strategies are needed that should be based on a quantitative assessment of the feasibility and impact of these measures. Building stock models (BSMs) have long been used to assess the current and future energy demand and GHG emissions of building stocks. Most common BSMs characterize the building stock through the use of archetype buildings, which are taken to be representative of large segments of the stock. The increasing availability of disaggregated datasets—such as building registries, 3D city models, and energy performance certificates—has given rise to building-specific BSMs focusing on describing the status quo as an input to energy planning, primarily on the urban scale. Owing to the availability of building-level data, BSMs can be extended beyond policy advice and urban planning, to the assessment of large building portfolios. Thus far, the advances made in building-specific BSMs on the urban scale have not been transferred to the national scale, where such datasets are often not available. Moreover, the focus on an increasingly detailed description of the existing stock has left approaches for modeling stock dynamics without much development. Stock dynamics, therefore, are still primarily modeled through exogenously defined retrofit, demolition, and new construction rates. This limits the applicability and reliability of model results, as the influence of economic, environmental, or policy factors on stock development is not considered. This thesis addresses these shortcomings and advances modeling practices in BSMs. The thesis with appended papers provides a methodology for how the modeling of national building stock can be further developed in terms of building stock characterization through synthetic building stocks as well as stock dynamics through the use of agent-based modeling. Furthermore, the thesis extends BSM applications to inform the strategic planning of large building portfolios through the integration of a maintenance and renovation scheduling method to project the future development of building portfolios.  },

    abstract={The reuse and remanufacturing of materials in urban areas is an important step towards closing local material cycles. Despite high potential, the use of these materials is currently hampered by various reasons, such as lack of coordination or insufficient exchange between the actors. There is no central point of contact at city level for bundling competencies in this field. The importance and possibility of establishing a central Center for Urban Re-manufacture (CURE) for sorting, storing and preparing for reuse and re-manufacturing of these materials was investigated in Gothenburg and Berlin, in a EIT Climate-KIC Pathfinder project. This article summarizes the findings and lessons of that project, which include an initiative review, market analyses, and participative workshops in both cities. The studies show that Gothenburg had a strong local authority engagement in the topic, while Berlin counted with several independent organizations already providing reuse services. The project managed to generate interest in this topic among local actors in both cities, which will hopefully result in the future establishment of some type of CURE in these locations. The article concludes that a combination of bottom-up and top-down engagement is needed to provide material recovery services at a city scale, involving stakeholders from across the existing material value chains.  },

Waste management has substantially incorporated recycling as an end-of-life treatment but has still largely failed to incorporate remanufacturing and reuse as possible material recovery routes. This article aims to provide useful information to establish centers for urban remanufacture (CUREs), by analyzing fifteen existing initiatives that facilitate reuse and remanufacture by providing access to secondary materials or manufacturing tools. The study consists of a review of selected initiatives complemented with targeted interviews to fill in missing information. Most initiatives provided access to secondary materials (13 of 15 initiatives), and almost all used different manufacturing tools (14 of 15 initiatives). Besides their regular opening hours, initiatives were mainly engaged in capacity building activities, which were done through predefined or improvised workshops. Most initiatives relied on external support to finance their operations (9 of 15 initiatives). However, one of the self-financed initiatives is the oldest initiative in the study, operating since 1998. Based on the results and tacit knowledge collected in this study, a framework is suggested to serve as a guide for establishing future CUREs.  },

Circular economy strategies can provide the means to both increase resource productivity and generate new business opportunities. Industrial symbiosis is one such strategy. We explore an industrial symbiosis application in this article. While most previous industrial symbiosis applications has been limited to eco-industrial parks, here we propose an adaptation of the industrial symbiosis and sustainable supply chain management concepts to urban areas in general. It is a way to develop economic clusters incorporating symbiotic links between multiple products supply chains. A proposed iterative facilitated industrial symbiosis method identifies an economic cluster focus, stakeholders, opportunities for resource exchange and sharing of infrastructure, as well as other important elements. The method provides systematic guidance for practitioners seeking ways to grow local industry and economy, increase resource productivity, reduce wastes, and better utilize local resources. Benefits of industrial symbiosis and barriers to its implementation are also identified in the method. The method comprises 5 phases, each illustrated on an example drawn from our application of the method in an urban development in Gothenburg, a city in Sweden.  },

While realizing the technical necessities, they also serve as an instrument towards multiple and often conflicting objectives during financial con- straints.

This study offers a systematic approach based on a condition-deteri- oration model to address the complexity involved in decision making regarding optimized main- tenance and renovation planning. Life-cycle cost analysis in form of Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) is used for the economic assessment of maintenance/renovation scenarios. In this paper, the model is used to compare the economy of different maintenance/renovation plans in a chosen scenario in order to determine the optimal maintenance interval for a single and a com- bination of building components. Two fac ̧ade elements, windows and fac ̧ade rendering, are used to illustrate the application of the proposed method.

    abstract={Improving the energy performance in the real estate sector has become increasingly important and drawn a lot of attention during the past few decades. Despite all the technological developments, the energy efficiency measures are yet expensive and when implemented only to improve the energy performance, are rarely economically justified. To lower the costs of energy performance improvements, an alternative is to combine energy efficiency measures with already required renovation measures. The problem with renovation on the other hand, is that its planning is not strategic; it is mainly opportunistic, short-term and with the focus on the capitalization of newly-discovered opportunities, meaning that renovation measures are coupled when one or more of the rather costly building components have reached failure. The take on an opportunistic approach, however convenient, results in loss of value which is most often neglected in the economic evaluation of renovation projects. The lack of strategic planning and the subsequent loss of value become more important in less-attractive markets, where there are both budget constraints and socio-economic issues. Energy performance and/or living standard are often sacrificed through improper distribution of resources as the choice of renovation measures are often influenced by the return of investment. Therefore, a proper evaluation of renovation alternatives not only can satisfy the technical and financial requirements but also help maintain proper living standard and improve the energy performance in multifamily buildings. In a prior study, authors have proposed a systematic approach to cost-optimal maintenance and renovation planning by combining the deterioration function of building components with respective service-life cycle costing. This paper presents an extension of that methodology to include the energy efficiency option pricing as an optimization criterion. The extended methodology is meant to provide support for housing owners in building management in forms of technical and economic evaluation of possible energy-renovation scenarios under time/budget constraints. To demonstrate the application of the methodology, maintenance/renovation plans are devised for three building components with sharing fixed costs (windows, faöade and roof) in both new and existing multifamily buildings.  },

    abstract={The need for winter road maintenance (WRM) is changing in cold regions due to climate change. How the different modes of WRM will contribute to future overall emissions from infrastructure is therefore of great interest to road owners with a view to a more sustainable, low-carbon future. In the quest for near-zero-emissions transport, all aspects of the transport sector need to be accounted for in the search for possible mitigation of emissions. This study used 35 peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2018 to map available information on the environmental impacts and effect of WRM and reveal any research gaps. The articles were categorized according to their research theme and focus. They were found to focus mainly on the local effects of WRM with emphasis on effects on water. Of the reviewed works, 27 contain information related to the environmental effects of deicers on a local level while five focused on global impact, which was mainly caused by fuel consumption. Only two articles took a holistic look at the system to identify emission sources and the effectiveness of possible changes in operations methods or material selection. In conclusion, WRM would benefit from further research to understand how it affects the natural environment in regions with a cold climate. Furthermore, a life-cycle approach could reveal ways to mitigate emissions through effectively comparing possible changes in the system without shifting the problem to other aspects of road transport.  },

Thus, LCM theoretically integrates all sustainability dimensions, and strives to provide a holistic perspective. It also assists in the efficient and effective use of constrained natural and financial resources to reduce negative impacts on society (Sonnemann and Leeuw 2006; Adibi et al. 2015). The LCM of infrastructures is the adaptation of product life cycle management (PLM) as techniques to the design, construction, and management of infrastructures. Infrastructure life cycle management requires accurate and extensive information that might be generated through different kinds of intelligent and connected information workflows, such as building information modeling (BIM).  },

    title={A comprehensive approach to building-stock modelling - Assessing the impact of renovating urban housing stocks},
    year={2019},
    abstract={The existing building stock provide a possibility for cost-efficient energy efficiency measures and related reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. As the rate of renewal in the buildingstock is low, energy efficiency measures need to be applied when renovation is being done in order to reach climate goals. To increase the renovation rate and realise the potential for substantial reductions in energy use, several research and demonstration projects have been carried out on both a European and Swedish level. In order to evaluate the current state and renovation potential of the existing building stock on an urban level, a local approach is needed to understand challenges and possibilities associated with the transformation of the building-stock. To quantify the potential for reducing energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions, building-stock modelling is commonly used. However, these models are often based on using representative buildings and scaling factors. With increased spatial resolution, building descriptions based on representative buildings lose accuracy and as a result, stakeholders operating at a planning or policy level are commonly targeted. This study proposes a building-specific stock description where each building is treated individually to differentiate the renovation potential within the building-stock. For this purpose, available databases containing building-specific information has been gathered and processed for the multi-family building stock of the City of Gothenburg. The available data is used to create a building-specific stock description and renovation measures are modelled using a bottom-up engineering method and evaluated regarding energy use, environmental impact and costeffectiveness. This thesis with appended papers shows that available data sources can be used to describe the characteristics of the stock on a building level and model the effect of renovation on energy use, environmental impact and cost-effectiveness in order to provide detailed information to policy makers, planners and property owners.  },

    abstract={Urban building-stocks are responsible for a significant share of resource and energy use. To quantify the potential for reducing energy and environmental impact, building-stock modelling (BSM) is commonly used. Recently, the focus of BSM has expanded to include environmental impacts and life-cycle assessment (LCA). However, impact categories are often limited to climate change and representative buildings are often used. In addition, the future state of the stock is often calculated as a step-change to highlight the technical potential of an ideal future state. The aim of this paper is to assess the environmental impact of the future development of an urban housing-stock under business-as-usual scenarios using a building-specific GIS based model applied to the multi-family building stock of the City of Gothenburg. This paper uses an explorative LCA to account for environmental impacts based on dynamic uptake of common renovation measures and resulting energy savings until 2050. Two main scenarios are used where the renovation logic is based on either end-of-life of components or cost-effectiveness and further divided using limiting factors regarding investment capacity and annual share of the stock to be renovated. Results show possible energy savings of up to 23% and a corresponding 31% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. Greenhouse-gas emissions avoided due to reduced energy demand are offset by up to 65% by accounting for material use due to construction related renovation measures. For scenarios that favour construction related interventions, PV panels are responsible for the major part of the environmental impact across the 15 mid-point indicators used.  },

    abstract={Cost-effectiveness of deep renovation has been assessed thoroughly on a building level. Such studies pro- vide limited guidance when prioritizing renovation measures for a building portfolio. On a stock level, building-stock modelling is commonly used to assess impact of renovation on a national and city level, targeting stakeholders operating at a planning or policy level. However, due to methodological choices and data availability, assessment of property owner portfolios is lacking. The aim of this paper is to cal- culate and spatially differentiate cost-effectiveness of deep renovation using equivalent annual cost and increase in assessed building value for a portfolio owner as a first step in prioritizing deep renovation within a building portfolio. A bottom-up engineering-based model is applied utilizing building-specific information for a municipal housing company portfolio in the City of Gothenburg, Sweden, consisting of 1803 multi-family buildings. Energy demand for space heating and hot-water is calibrated using mea- sured energy use from energy performance certificates. Deep renovation is assessed by applying a pack- age of measures across all buildings. Results show average energy use reduction across the portfolio of 51% to an average cost of 597 EUR/m 2 living area. While average energy cost savings account for 21% of equivalent annual cost, there are seven buildings where more than half the annual equivalent cost of renovation is covered by energy cost savings. Similarly, the distribution of change in assessed build- ing value is large for individual buildings, ranging from 0–23%. Aggregating results to larger areas tend to average out results while differences between individual buildings within areas persists. As such, the cost-effectiveness of deep renovation should be assessed on a building-by-building basis rather than for an area or neighbourhood. The results are intended as a first step in prioritizing deep renovation within a building portfolio and further detailed assessment is needed.  },

This often requiring hours of measurements and a sufficient number of observations to obtain valid findings. The purpose of current work is to introduce a screening emission accounting as a way to have a quick overview of emissions associated with non-road mobile machinery by having a simplified assessment method. To meet this aim, this study uses documented data from performances of machinery and couples them with the recently published guidebook by the European Emission Agency. To map the results, operational performances of four wheel loaders operating in quarries to move stone materials are used, equipped with Stage IV engines and net power output in a range between 130 ≤ kW < 560. The obtained results showed that the positive correlation between an increase in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions is not changed. The mass of emissions, however, is better addressed if emissions are linked with the efficiency of equipment, instead of effective hour. Machinery that consumed less fuel per m3 moved volume of materials, resulted in having less emissions compared to those that had higher fuel consumption per m3 moved volume.  },

The exercise began with a systematic collection and harmonization of raw data from the last two decades of thermal comfort field studies around the world. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II (Comfort Database), now an online, open-source database, includes approximately 81,846 complete sets of objective indoor climatic observations with accompanying “right-here-right-now” subjective evaluations by the building occupants who were exposed to them. The database is intended to support diverse inquiries about thermal comfort in field settings. A simple web-based interface to the database enables filtering on multiple criteria, including building typology, occupancy type, subjects' demographic variables, subjective thermal comfort states, indoor thermal environmental criteria, calculated comfort indices, environmental control criteria and outdoor meteorological information. Furthermore, a web-based interactive thermal comfort visualization tool has been developed that allows end-users to quickly and interactively explore the data.  },

However, MIC databases are site specific and not available in many countries. For this reason, a MIC database of residential buildings in Sweden was created in this study. As these had not previously been explored, considerable attention was paid to MIC database results, variables and limitations. Next, to contextualize the results, the database was compared and discussed with other studies in other geographical scales and regions. The MIC database is based on (1) specialized architectural-data and (2) densities of construction materials. The study looked at 46 typical residential buildings in Sweden, 12 single-family (SF) and 34 multi-family (MF) structures, built within the time period 1880ö2010. The results show specific trends for material intensity and composition, but also for the mass distribution of different building elements. Additionally, it was shown that the number of floors and the footprint size of a building have a considerable impact on the MICs, especially for buildings with a low number of floors, such as SF structures. Furthermore, when compared to MIC databases from other countries, the study database, which relates to Sweden, shows a higher intensity for wood and steel. Finally, contradictory MIC results for similar geographical regions were highlighted and discussed. This showed that to achieve consistent standardized MIC databases, further analysis of MIC databases for different geographical scales and regions are needed, and this is therefore recommended.  },

The first is a CE Strategies Database, which includes 45 CE strategies that are applicable to different parts of the value chain. The second is a CE Implementation Database, which includes over 100 case studies categorized by Scope, Parts of the Value Chain that are involved, as well as by the used Strategy and Implementation Level. An analysis of the state of the art in CE implementation is also included in the paper. One of the observations from the analysis is that while such Parts of the Value Chain as Recovery/Recycling and Consumption/Use are prominently featured, others, including Manufacturing and Distribution, are rarely involved in CE. On the other hand, the Implementation Levels of the used Strategies indicate that many market-ready solutions exist already. The Scope of current CE implementation considers selected products, materials and sectors, while system changes to economy are rarely suggested. Finally, the CE monitoring methods and suggestions for future development are also discussed in this paper. The analysis of the theoretical approaches can serve as an introduction to CE concept, while the developed tools can be instrumental for designing new CE cases.  },

Hotspot analysis and impact assessments were conducted by social and environmental life cycle assessment (LCA). The assessed green concrete represented not just the variety of geographic representation but also the product designs (three different slag contents) and the potential difference occurring from the corporate efforts, where four classes were introduced. The investigation of the social and environmental hotspots of the green concrete revealed a difference in the relation between the sustainability performance and steel slags. While the increased slag content resulted in worse social performance, the increase improved the environmental performance in all six investigated case countries. This trade-off between the social and environmental performance implied the limits of the sustainable product design and suggested the effectiveness of the supply chain management for improving the two sustainability performances for the green concrete.  },

In many European countries, the building stock from this time needs to be renovated, and there are opportunities to introduce energy efficiency measures in the renovation process. Information availability and increasingly available analysis tools make it possible to assess the impact of policy and regulation. This article describes methods developed for analyzing investments in renovation and energy performance based on building ownership and inhabitant socio-economic information developed for Swedish authorities, to be used for the Swedish national renovations strategy in 2019. This was done by analyzing measured energy usage and renovation investments made during the last 30 years, coupled with building specific official information of buildings and resident area characteristics, for multi-family dwellings in Gothenburg (N = 6319). The statistical analyses show that more costly renovations lead to decreasing energy usage for heating, but buildings that have been renovated during the last decades have a higher energy usage when accounting for current heating system, ownership, and resident socio-economic background. It is appropriate to include an affordability aspect in larger renovation projects since economically disadvantaged groups are over-represented in buildings with poorer energy performance.  },

    abstract={In Europe, the final energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of residential and commercial building stocks account for approximately 40% of energy and emissions. A building stock model (BSM) is a method of assessing the energy demand and GHG emissions of building stocks and developing pathways for energy and GHG emission reduction. The most common approach to building stock modeling is to construct archetypes that are taken to representing large segments of the stock. This paper introduces a new method of building stock modeling based on the generation of synthetic building stocks. By drawing on relevant research, the developed methodology uses aggregate national data and combines it with various data sources to generate a disaggregated synthetic building stock. The methodology is implemented and validated for the residential building stock of Switzerland. The results demonstrate that the energy demand and GHG emissions can vary greatly across the stock. These and other indicators vary significantly within common building stock segments that consider only few attributes such as building type and construction period. Furthermore, the results indicate a separation of the stock in terms of GHG emissions between old fossil fuel-heated buildings and new and refurbished buildings that are heated by renewable energy. Generating a disaggregated synthetic building stock allows for a discrete representation of various building states. This enables a more realistic representation of past building stock alterations, such as refurbishment, compared with commonly used archetypes, and not relying on more extensive data sources and being able to accommodate a wide variation of data types. The developed methodology can be extended in numerous manners and lays groundwork for future studies.  },

    abstract={Effective and efficient road transportation in Norway is a continuing concern. The growth in population and the continuing need for better infrastructure to serve this population propel the growth of road construction. Roads will continue to occupy the most prominent place in the Norwegian transport puzzle as the most commonly used form of transport by both people and goods today. The quadrennial National Transport Plan guides large scale transport planning in Norway and has recently included national CO2 emissions reductions targets for all new road infrastructure and construction. At the same time, the investment in Norwegian road infrastructure is at an all-time high, as authorities seek to modernize the Norwegian road network through megaprojects, such as the Ferry Free E39. This increase in investment and construction will inevitably lead to an increase in resource consumption and emissions without wise planning decisions, smart material choices and the use of sustainability assessment tools. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is one such tool that is used to measure environmental impacts of infrastructure and construction processes, including climate change emissions. To what extent LCA is already used in Norwegian road planning and what lessons can be learned from earlier studies that can apply to today’s megaprojects are of interest to road builders if emissions reduction goals are to be taken seriously. The purpose of this paper is to determine the state-of-the-art of Norwegian road LCA and determine in which direction Norwegian research should move. The first section of the paper looks at the overarching conditions for Norwegian road construction in terms of planning, trends, and policy; the second section looks at relevant LCA studies on Norwegian roads, while the third section looks at possible research paths which should be followed to better assess and reduce the impacts of emissions in road infrastructure.  },

    abstract={Material usage and the related embodied environmental impact have grown in significance in the built environment. Therefore, cities and governments need to develop strategies to reduce both the consumption of resources during usage phase as well as the embodied impact of the current building stock. This article proposes a new component-based building inventory database as a basis to develop such strategies using building stock modeling. The developed database clusters the building stock according to building typology (single- family houses, multifamily houses, and office buildings), age, and the main construction systems of the different building components. Based on the component makeup, it lists the necessary material input and waste output for different refurbishment options for each building component. The advantages of the proposed database structure are shown based on two applications for the developed database for Switzerland. The component- based database allows optimization of refurbishment strategies not only from an energetic perspective, but also with respect to materials, both on the input (sourcing of materials) and the output (waste streams) level. The database structure makes it possible to continuously extend the data set by adding new refurbishment options or add data such as component- specific lifetimes, costs, or labor intensities of the refurbishment options. In combination with an aligned economic model, this would give an even more holistic view, impact, and feasibility of different refurbishment scenarios both in environmental and economic terms.

Nevertheless, Small and Medium Enterprises face many challenges when it comes to fostering innovation and improving environmental performance as part of their day-to-day activities. In parallel, the global consumption of raw materials is increasing, which makes it necessary to define and establish strategies to reduce the amount of, and dependence on, raw material extraction and imports, whilst also improving the sustainability of SMEs. In this context it is essential to promote circular economy strategies, such as industrial symbiosis partnerships, where companies use the waste products of other industries as raw materials. To achieve this, there is a need to find enablers to support industrial symbiosis collaborations among SMEs. These could include regional developers and local authorities. The aims of this study are to investigate whether industrial symbiosis is already a common practice within SMEs in the Västra Götaland Region of Sweden, as well as identifying barriers and motivations for partnerships. For this purpose, case studies of two industries were carried out: beer production and mushroom farming. Information was collected using on-site visits and semi-structured interviews, and the key findings where combined with a literature review, then used to propose new industrial symbiosis opportunities. The results show that industrial symbiosis is already used by some of the beer and mushroom producers. Economic gains and better environmental performance were presented as the main motivations for the companies to be involved in these partnerships. Nevertheless, industrial symbiosis could be extended to also include those companies that do not yet share their waste, mostly due to a lack of time or knowledge. Consequently, the study suggests potential industrial symbiosis partnerships that could be implemented within a short period of time, and be used by the local authorities to help SMEs to achieve circularity of wastes. Future work considers the dissemination of the results among SMEs as well as apply the approach to other types of industries operating in the region to identify additional IS potential partnerships.  },

    abstract={The use of cellulosic materials in the construction of low-rise housing in tropical climates has great potential. Bambusa blumeana (B. blumeana, J.A. and J.H. Schultes), the most abundantly available bamboo species in the Philippines, is a promising alternative material for the construction of cost-efficient buildings. However, to comply with municipal rules and regulations for construction, a comprehensive understanding of the organic raw material is needed to permit its application as a load-bearing structural member. In this study, the physical and mechanical properties of B. blumeana bamboo from a typical growth region of the Philippines were tested according to ISO 22157-1 (2004) and ISO 22157-2 (2004). The characteristic strength values of B. blumeana were as follows: compressive and tensile strengths parallel to the grain of 20 and 95 MPa, respectively; shear strength of 5 MPa, bending strength of 34.6 MPa, and the mean and fifth percentile modulus of elasticity of 13100 and 8600 MPa, respectively. Based on these results, a recommendation for permissible stresses for structural design was made in line with ISO 22156 (2004).  },

    abstract={Även om den teoretiska och tekniska potentialen för att minska energianvändningen i befintliga byggnader är stor, är den faktiska besparingspotentialen mindre känd. Syftet med projektet är att utveckla en metodik för att identifiera renoverings-, tillbyggnads- och nybyggnadsalternativ för urbana byggnadsbestånd som är miljömässigt och ekonomiskt gynnsamma och där energibesparingsåtgärder ligger i centrum. Projektet utgår från existerande beräkningsmodeller men kombinerar dessa på nytt sätt. En tidigare utvecklad byggnadsbeståndsmodell integrerad i geografiska informationssystem kombineras med en byggnadsfysikalisk modell för större byggnadsbestånd (ECCABS modellen - Energy, Carbon and Cost Assessment for Building-Stocks) samt livscykelanalys. Genom att använda byggnadsspecifik information och hantera byggnader i deras lokala kontext kan en mer holistisk syn uppnås. Tillgängliga databaser med byggnadsspecifika data har samlats och processats för flerbostadsbeståndet i Göteborg. Data används för beskrivningar av flerbostadshusbeståndets energiprestanda och framtida renoveringsbehov som i sin tur används som input för beräkningar av energibehoven. Beskrivningen och analysen tar hänsyn till byggnadens ålder, värdeår, ägare, geometri som länkas till ett geografiskt läge, och används för modelleringen av byggnadernas energiprestanda. Byggnadsbeståndsbeskrivningen hanterar varje byggnad som unik och tillåter på så sätt differentierade beskrivningar av byggnadsbestånd, dvs resultaten kan aggregeras på önskad skala för att passa olika intressenters behov. Bland annat har olika renoveringsscenarios tagits fram för att undersöka energisparpotentialen fram till år 2035. Resultaten visar att trots potential att minska den specifika energianvändningen i det befintliga beståndet så förblir den totala energianvändningen i flerbostadshusbeståndet i det närmaste oförändrad på grund av den tillkommande energianvändningen i nybyggnationen. I detta projekt har flerbostadshusbeståndet i Göteborg studerats men metodiken är generellt tillämpbar oavsett geografiskt område. Metodiken kan användas för prioritering av olika energieffektiviseringsåtgärder vid renovering där fastighetsförvaltare, i nuläget främst bostadsbolag, är den huvudsakliga målgruppen. Även andra beslutfattare såsom kommunala energiplanerare och stadsplanerare kan stödjas i sitt beslutsfattande för att uppnå en hållbar transformation av urbana byggnadsbestånd. Genom implementeringen av metoden i ett geografiskt informationssystem ges inte bara möjlighet att undersöka vilka besparingsåtgärder som är gynnsamma för en effektivare energi- och resursanvändning utan också att prioritera vilka geografiska områden som får mest ut av dessa åtgärder. Den framtagna metodiken kan ses som ett första steg i ett försök att formalisera och strukturera modellering, visualisering och kommunikation av resultat. Ytterligare forskning behövs för att kunna bedöma och utvärdera potentialen genom kvalitativa, fördjupade behovsstudier riktade till bostads- och fastighetsbolag.

    abstract={Urban building-stocks use a significant amount of resources and energy. At the same time, theyhave a large potential for energy efficiency measures (EEM). To support decision-making and planning, spatial building-stock models are used to examine the current state and future development of urbanbuilding-stocks. While these models normally focus on specific cities, generic and broad stakeholder groups such as planners and policy makers are often targeted. Consequently, the visualization and communication of results are not tailored to these stakeholders. The aim of this paper is to explore the possibilities of mapping and representing energy use of urban building-stocks at different levels of aggregation and spatial distributions, to communicate with specific stakeholders involved in the urban development process. This paper uses a differentiated building-stock description based on building-specific data andmeasured energy use fromenergy performance certificates formulti-family buildings (MFB) in the city of Gothenburg. The building-stock description treats every building as unique, allowing results to be provided at any level of aggregation to suit the needs of the specific stakeholders involved. Calculated energy use of the existing stock is within 10% of the measured energy use. The potential for EEM in the existing stock is negated by the increased energy use due to new construction until 2035, using a development scenario based on current renovation rates and planned developments. Visualizations of the current energy use of the stock as well as the impact of renovation and new construction are provided, targeting specific local stakeholders.  },

    abstract={Innovation in construction is becoming increasingly important. Many studies on construction innovation focus either on the project level or on top management. In doing so, the in between group of midlevel managers risks to be neglected. If studied, middle managers are often narrowly defined to fit the mechanistic implementation of top management ideas. This does injustice to the importance of middle managers and the variety of their roles in innovation. In this paper, we address the different roles that middle managers may adopt in relation to innovation. A literature review and a case study were conducted at a regional housing division of a large Swedish contractor. In 10 semi-structured interviews and a vision seminar the middle managers were asked to voice their perceptions about innovation in the division and about their own role. Systematisation of working practices, employee development, and health, safety and sustainability measures were perceived to be the most important innovations. Four different roles of the middle manager have been examined: implementer of change, networker, sensemaker and enabler. Most middle managers identified with different mixtures of these ideal types. On this background, we discuss how middle managers may advance these roles to contribute to innovation in housing construction.  },

    year={2017},
    abstract={This paper presents a micro-level study of an organisation considering to standardise a facility management process. Standards serve an instrumental purpose in the built environment reducing complexity by promoting similarity across time and space. However, differences in practices and perceptions of involved actors can make standardisation a complex endeavour itself, limiting its effectiveness as a mode of governance. Science and technology studies (STS) approaches are used to study standards in the inspection process. Standardisation is understood in this study as performative and a process of power, understanding, and emerging interests. The empirical material stems from a case study of a pier facility management process at the port of Gothenburg. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with actors involved in the inspection process – asset managers, structural engineers, inspectors and a document controller. Additional observations made during pier inspections and project meetings at the port were used to develop the context of the study. The analysis shows the multiple demands and interpretations present among involved actors prior to an attempt to standardise the pier inspection process. Asset managers and structural engineers voice a preference for guidelines that support ideal ways of working implemented using a checklist. Alternatively, inspectors wish to receive a common terminology. More strategically, the symbolic value of an ISO type standard matches a perceived need by the port management for credibility to satisfy customer demands. Simultaneously, a standard is expected to give clear directives to hired consultants, make the process more cost efficient and ensure a stable quality. The variety of interpretations and demands observed in this study underlines the social character of asset and facility management and the uses of standards. It is suggested to reflect on socio-technical conditions in standard design.  },

At the current stage, the SSO methodology aims to implement a new paradigm of user-oriented, lower carbon footprint and resilient office design solutions. The main strategy is articulated around the “office DNA” of every organisation, decoded as a compound of work patterns, operational and individual needs, and their potential to define design criteria.

Nevertheless, in public and private sectors sustainability results are still disappointing, and this paper reflects on this problem and proposes a way forward. We argue that, because sustainability issues are generally wicked problems (i.e. a ‘complex of interconnected factors in a pluralistic context’), effective assessments need to be reflexive about the definition of the issue and about the criteria for sustainable solutions. Based on a distinction of policy problems, we characterize SA as a form of problem structuring, and we distinguish three typical ways of problem structuring, corresponding to three different ways of integrating reflexivity in the assessment. We illustrate these routes in three examples. We discuss the way reflexivity is integrated in each example by discussing the mix of methods, SA process and epistemological balance. Rather than merely calling for more st akeholder participation, our aim is to call for more reflexivity integrated into the SA approach, and we conclude by proposing a process map for reflexive sustainability assessment to support this.  },

    abstract={Given the global trends of rising energy demand and the increasing utilization of low-grade renewable energy, low-temperature heating systems can play key roles in improving building energy efficiency while providing a comfortable indoor environment. To meet the need to retrofit existing buildings in Nordic countries for greater energy efficiency, this study focused on human subjects’ thermal sensation, thermal comfort, thermal acceptability, draft acceptability, and perceived air quality when three low-temperatureheating systems were used: conventional radiator, ventilation radiator, or floor heating with exhaust ventilation. Human subject tests were carried out in the climate chamber at the Technical University of Denmark. In total, 24 human subjects, 12 females and 12 males, participated in the tests during the winter season. The results show that no significant differences in thermal sensation and thermal comfort between the three heating systems. Ventilation radiator promised a comfortable indoor environment with a decreased watersupply temperature and floor heating with exhaust ventilation can provide a basic thermal comfort level. Thermal acceptability and draft acceptability show variations in different heating systems. Gender has significant influences on thermal sensation, draft acceptability, and preference of clo values. Personal thermal preference is observed between males and females. The males prefer to dress lighter than the females, but both can get the same thermal comfort level. It is concluded that low-temperature heating systems using exhaust air ventilation are a potentially solution when buildings are being retrofitted for improved energy efficiency and comfort of the occupants.  },

The PV system investigated in this study is assumed to be connected to the electricity grid. However, because there is a difference between the electricity tariff and feed-in electricity price, adding a battery to such a system improves its economic viability. But the application of a battery increases initial costs of the system. Therefore, it is especially of economic relevance to choose the optimal size of the battery. In this work, the optimal battery size was calculated under different parameters including electricity tariff, feed-in electricity price, and battery performance and price. For this purpose, an actual building located in Landskrona, Sweden was chosen as a case study. A computer model was built to simulate the PV system. The simulations show that the optimal battery size is strongly influenced by the local conditions especially the feed-in electricity price.  },

This paper studies the role of building information standards for classification in digitization of the building life cycle. It draws on science and technology studies of information technology standards, big data and building information modelling (BIM) in building research. The approach is based on performativity of standards for information systems, viewing performativity as potentially non-linear and multiple. The five-year design process of a large hospital in Denmark is examined as episodes of performance of the building information standard, particularly one recent standard, the Cuneco Classification System (CCS). The study shows that despite client demands, several building information standards are active over time: an expansive' design brief process adds user demands and uses room classification. Another process diminishes the design brief more than 50%, with several standards in use. The client's facilities management system, which performs the structuring of data backwards' into the design process, makes architects and engineers (but not contractors) use CCS. This fragmentation of performing standards is denoted multiple performativities' and includes temporal and compartmental performativity.  },

    abstract={PurposeThe share of variable renewable energy sources (vRES) in the German electricity grid has increased over the past few decades. Due to the nature of the generation pattern of vRES, the increase of vRES causes the emission factor (EF) to fluctuate on an hourly basis. This fluctuation raises concerns about the accuracy of quantifying emissions with the current metric of the annual average EF as the respective EF may change depending on the time at which it is consumed.MethodsThe study calculated the hourly EF of Germany from 2011 to 2015 and investigated the effect of an increase of vRES on the EF. The calculated hourly EF was clustered based on three aspects of time: the period of time, the time of a day, and the day of the week.Results and discussionThe study showed a higher proportion of vRES on weekend daytimes while the weekday nighttimes resulted in a lower share than the annual average. The study highlighted potential underestimation and overestimation of emissions by using annual average EF which ranged from +22% (2015 weekday nighttime of October) to −34% (2015 weekend daytime of May).ConclusionsThe study suggested that the application of hourly EF may be necessary to quantify the respective emission from the consumers that use electricity during the weekend daytime and weekend nighttime. For consumer use at other times, the emissions could be quantified appropriately by using the conventional annual average EF.  },

    journal={Proceedings of World Sustainable Built Environment Conference 2017},
    year={2017},
    abstract={European countries face a large challenge in retrofitting their aging building stock, which they need to embark on, in order to reach European Union (EU) energy and emission reduction targets. Despite significant policy interventions, refurbishment rates remain low and the refurbishments that are carried out often do not meet the energy savings targeted by the EU, for example nearly Zero-Energy Building standards (nZEB). One of the key reasons for the lower than expected energy savings is that current refurbishment approaches tend to focus predominantly on energy efficiency improvements for individual buildings. The integrated energy systems perspective that can be leveraged at a multi-building scale – and is related to possible interactions between building sizes, scales, and the different systems – is not taken into consideration in most refurbishment concepts. The result are suboptimal renovation solutions which do not reach the full energy demand reduction potential of the refurbished building(s).This paper introduces a methodology for a tool that aims to develop economically and environmentally optimal nZEB refurbishment concepts for multi-building scale refurbishment actions. Increasing the scale of a refurbishment from a single building to a multiple building, or even a building portfolio, will allow to generate economies of scale (both for solution and workforce cost) and facilitate the integration of renewable energy generation. The tool applies the Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) and Lifecycle Cost Assessment (LCC) methods, which makes it possible to optimize refurbishment concepts, both with respect to economic and environmental criteria. Thanks to a multidimensional optimization approach, based on an evolutionary algorithm that can automatically find the Pareto-boarder for a given design space, Pareto-optimal refurbishment concepts are generated. Refurbishment options presented this way can help housing companies prioritize refurbishment needs and actions in their building portfolios, as well as evaluate and select between different refurbishment approaches in line with overarching targets.  },

First, a short review is made over five existing spaces that allow residents to leave and take products to be used again by others. Then, the initial experiences of establishing such a space in the HSB Living Lab in Gothenburg are presented to complement the review. In general the experiences of establishing these rooms for change are positive, with users making use of the space frequently. Aspects such as location and open hours are crucial to make the change-stations convenient for residents to use. Making the space available to a large group ofpeople is important to ensure good product flow and renewal. Even though these spaces enable product exchange between users, it is not always possible to link this exchange to a measureable effect on reduced waste generation or consumption. It is not always true that the items exchangedwould have been discarded or purchased if the space to change them was not available. There is an exception when the exchanged items are food, since the food made available for others to take would have been wasted otherwise.  },

    abstract={Carbon Capture and Utilization is an attractive strategy not only due to its potential for CO2 emissions reduction but also because it enables the creation of valuable products. The development of CO2-based industrial symbiosis partnerships can contribute significantly towards achieving the goals of GHG emissions reduction on a European level by 2030, while at the same time it leads to an increased added value through the development of new production lines and carbon neutral products. The presented article focuses on identifying potential partnerships between companies that produce CO2 and companies that may reuse CO2 as input for their industrial process. A novel methodological framework is presented based on developing generic matrices for CO2 sources and receivers and matching the industrial units based on geographical and technical criteria. Moreover, the paper provides the technical requirements of 17 CO2 utilization technologies with relatively high technology readiness level, including the CO2-to-product ratio, the required purity, pressure, temperature and the presence of a catalyst, as well as potential synergies and additional requirements. The methodology has been applied to the Vastra Gotaland region in West Sweden and the most promising CCU symbioses have been identified. These include mineral carbonation (annual uptake: 59,600 tCO(2)), greenhouses (26,000 tCO(2)), algae production, methanol production (85,500 tCO(2)), power to gas (66,500 tCO(2)), pH control, lignin production, polymers synthesis and concrete curing (96,000 tCO(2)). If all of them could be applied, the total annual CO2 reduction would exceed 250,000 tCO(2) per year.  },

The adoption of Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) technologies may contribute towards carbon sequestration as well as to the creation of high value products. This study presents a methodology to assess the potential of CO2 utilization across Europe, and to identify the European regions with the greater potential to deploy nine selected carbon dioxide utilization technologies. The results show that Germany, UK and France at the first level followed by Spain, Italy and Poland are the countries where the larger quantities of available CO2 could be found but also where the majority of the potential receiving processes are located, and therefore with the greatest potential for CO2 utilization. The study has also revealed several specific regions where reuse schemes based on CO2 could be developed both in Central Europe (Dusseldorf and Cologne - Germany, Antwerp Province and East Flanders - Belgium and ?laskie - Poland) and in Scandinavia (Etelä-Suomi and Helsinki-Uusimaa - Finland). Finally, among all the selected technologies, concrete curing and horticulture production are the technologies with the higher potential for CO2 utilization in Europe.  },

    abstract={Increased precipitation and risk of flooding are major effects due to climate change that Swedish municipalities need to consider, while facing an ongoing growth in population and densification of urban areas. In this context, urban stormwater management represents a growing challenge. The vulnerability of the society towards climate change depends on the capability of the city to responds to environmental issues. This report presents the challenges and the needs for the implementation of sustainable stormwater solutions encountered in the urban planning process for the city of Gothenburg. The decision making process can be facilitated by the adoption of a stormwater toolbox, which functionalities are designed to support the stakeholders at each step of the planning process. The modules of the toolbox should be designed around a collaboration platform that assists with transparent information flows and allocation of responsibilities. The specific modules (e.g. hydrology, cost-benefit analysis, experience database) should support the needs along the different phases in the process. This study was financially supported by Climate KIC. The Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) are partnerships set up by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, EIT, that bring together businesses, research centers and universities with the purpose of developing innovative products and services, starting new companies and training a new generation of entrepreneurs.

    abstract={Purpose The environmental impact of the social buildingstock is relevant, particularly in emerging economies. Life cycle thinking is not yet established, however. Locally available, alternative building concepts could potentially reduce the environmental impact of the construction segment. This paper examines the environmental performance of Bas-built low-cost housing for an example of the Philippines, and the potential to reduce its environmental impact through use of three alternative building technologies: cement–bamboo frames, soil–cement blocks, and coconut board-based housing.Methods Life cycle assessment models are implemented andevaluated with software SimaPro, using the single-impact indicators global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED) and the multi-impact indicator Impact2002+. According to EN 15978, the life cycle phase product and construction process (A), use stage (B), end-of-life (C) and supplementary information beyond the building life cycle (D) have been assessed. Theoretically calculated inflows from standard construction procedures used in phase A have been verified with 3 years of empirical data from implemented construction projects. For phases B, C and D, attention was given to servicelife, use-phase, allocation of waste products, biogenic carbon and land-use assumptions. Scenarios reflect the actual situation in the emerging economy. Processes, such as heat recovery from thermal utilization, which are not existing nor near to implementation, were excluded.Results and discussion For an assessment of the phases A–B–C–D with GWP, a 35% reduction of environmental impact for soil–cement blocks, 74%for cement–bamboo frame, and 83% for coconut board-based houses is obtained relative to a concrete reference house. In absolute terms, this relates to a reduction of 4.4, 9.3, and 10.3 t CO2 equivalents over a service life of 25 years. CED showed higher impacts for the biogenic construction methods coconut board and cement–bamboo frames of +8.0 and +4.7%, while the soil–cement technology was evaluated −7.1% compared to GWP. Sixteen of 17 midpoint categories of Impact2002+ confirmed an overall reduction potential of the alternative building methods, with the midpoint category land occupation being the exception rating the conventional practice over the alternatives.Conclusions It is concluded that the alternative construction technologies have substantial potential to reduce the environmental burden caused by the social housing sector. The service life of the alternative technologies plays a vital role for it. LCA for emerging economies needs to incorporate realistic scenarios applicable at their current state or belonging to the most probable alternatives to ensure valuable results.Recommendations for further research are provided.  },

    abstract={The transformation of urban building-stocks is fundamental to achieve climate change mitigation targets. As therate of renewal of the building-stock is low, energy efficiency measures need to be applied when renovation isbeing done. To evaluate the renovation potential of the existing building stock on an urban level, a local approachis needed to understand challenges and possibilities associated with its transformation. The aim of this study is toinvestigate the renovation needs and potentials for implementation of energy efficiency measures in relation toowner and type of ownership for the buildings. For this purpose, available databases containing building-specificinformation have been gathered and processed for the multi-family building stock of the city of Gothenburg,Sweden. These data sources are used to describe the energy performance of the stock and future renovationneeds based on type of property ownership while considering the location and context of the buildings usinggeographic information systems. Building attributes such as year of construction, value year, property owner,geometric data and energy performance certificates are spatially linked and visualized to describe the energyperformance of buildings and its relation to renovation need, providing detailed and valuable information to propertyowners. Buildings from the period 1960 - 1975 are of particular importance as they constitute 42% of the multifamilybuilding stock, have the highest average energy use (146 kWh/m2/year) and have to a large extent not beenrenovated. The municipality’s housing company own 36 % of the total stock and even more so considering buildingsfrom this period. While there will be a significant challenge in renovating their stock, this also presents anopportunity for large reductions in energy use. By incorporating building-specific information and considering thebuilding in its local setting, a more holistic and realistic view on energy saving potentials can be achieved. Theresults aim to support owners of larger property portfolios in prioritizing buildings suitable for renovation.  },

    abstract={The possibility of integrating energy harvesting devices into the bridge/tunnel structures along Coastal Highway Route E39 has been investigated in a feasibility study by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA). The main advantage of integrating energy conversion devices in a structural element is the reduction of costs compared to stand-alone devices. The construction could be used as a foundation, a mooring point and provide a dry environment for electrical devices. Easy access to the production site could also reduce the cost for installation, operation and maintenance. Two important challenges related to harvesting renewable energy by infrastructure elements, without concerning about the energy source, are to store it or feed the energy to the grid. In the second case, tailoring generation to demand is of critical importance. Tasks such as supply and demand management, for instance, peak hour management, what kind of storage should be used - electrical or thermal - need be solved. Furthermore, integrating energy production devices in a structure might cause negative environmental impacts and affect the life expectancy and maintenance costs of such structures. The potential environmental impacts associated with renewable technologies are the consequences for bird life or marine fauna at the fjord crossing locations, as well as noise and visual impact. Thus, a sustainability assessment should be performed in order to quantify the ecological, economical and societal impacts of the suggested alternatives.  },

    year={2016},
    abstract={The increased use of BIM in the building sector have led certain actors to commence riding on the big data hype. Big data techniques allow the use of unstructured data alongside structured data to an extent that was previously impossible. Science and technology studies (STS) approaches are used to examine information standards as a technology to organise big data applications in building. Crucially, opportunities are strongly guided by the data that is collected about buildings, and thus by the understanding of what a building is. Building information standards are viewed as performative and their becoming as a process of power, understanding and emerging interests. The empirical material stems from a study on the shaping of a Danish classification standard and its implementation in a Danish hospital project. The analysis shows several performative aspects and particular ways in which a building can be understood: First, there is a focus on the internal structure of a building as a product and less on the process that leads to making a product. Second, a systems theory approach to building structure understands building components as having functions in a way that aligns well with the installation part of the building. Third, delimitations within which information standards propose to collect data implies a focus on building components as material over components being economical entities. Performativity struggles during the shaping of the standard are expected to continue also during its implementation phase in an environment where multiple standards co-exist. On this background we discuss whether the building information standard, meant to be a big data technology enabler, might become a barrier for big data.  },

Without denying the urgency of reducing CO2 emissions, it is important to recognise that this is only one of several categories of requirements for creating a more sustainable energy system. This chapter discusses three of these categories: (1) access and security, (2) climate change and environmental impact,(3) economic and social development. The problem of dealing with three different perspectives is illustrated with reference to the development of concentrated solar power. It is clear that a more sustainable energy system cannot be achieved using the simple creed that renewables reduce CO2 emissions and are therefore good. Understanding the different issues that need addressing may not in itself resolve disagreement, but will at least create a common understanding of what is involved.  },

Energy efficiency measures on existing buildings, however, are often economically feasible only if executed at the same time as the execution of necessary maintenance and refurbishment measures. At the strategic level it would be useful to be able to better plan the costs and benefits of energy efficiency measures so that decisions could be made to execute them when the opportunity arises.In this paper, a Cost-Performance-Indicator (CPI) curve is proposed to indicate additional costs and benefits of energy efficiency measures at a strategic level, and evidence is given that corroborates the hypothesis that energy efficiency measures follow the law of increasing relative costs. The usefulness of the CPI curve is demonstrated through two case studies. An example is provided and the potential is discussed for using this curve for the planning and budgeting of refurbishment and energy efficiency measures, and as a tool to explain the relation between costs and benefits of measures enhancing building energy efficiency, including the production of renewable energy, to investors.  },

The assessment was based on an open-air road (excluding tunnels and bridges) with afunctional unit of one kilometer and greenhouse gas emissions as well as embodied energyindicators were evaluated in the considered software tools. The open-air road was modeled foreach software tool with respects to road class H9 characteristic in Norway, classed as a nationalroad. The assessment showed that the system boundary and purpose of use differed between theconsidered software tools. This resulted in performing the assessment only over A1 – 4 and B6modules according to EN 15978 standard for the hypothetical open-air road to provide acomparable boundary condition. The results demonstrated that EFFEKT overall yielded highervalues for greenhouse gas emissions and embodied energy compared to the two other softwaretools, while, the three software tools quantified nearly the same amount of asphalt use within the20-year analysis period.  },

    abstract={Today it is widely recognized that the construction industry plays a key role in the rational use of resources and the realization of a more sustainable society. Concerning buildings and energy use, renovation of the existing building stock to the higher energy performance is crucial. Among the various existing buildings in Europe, school buildings are of importance among the publicly owned buildings. However, there has been little effort in Sweden to promote the school building renovation by prefabricated wooden modules, which should be highly advantageous due to the short refurbishment period and its light weight.The present study investigated the hygrothermal property of wooden refurbishment modules in combination with an existing brick wall under Gothernburg (Sweden) climate. The criterion for the moisture safety inside the wall after the refurbishment was at 75% relative humidity in order to comply with the Swedish building regulation while it was assumed that the surface of the wall was wet from the precipitation during the refurbishment period. Two-dimensional transient heat and moisture transfer simulation was applied to three different module configurations. It was shown it is important to design the module vapour permeable so the entire wall system after the refurbishment have sufficient drying potential.  },

    abstract={Purpose Life cycle assessment (LCA) has not been widely applied in the building design process because it is perceived to be complex and time-consuming. There is a high demand for simplified approaches that architects can use without detailed knowledge of LCA. This paper presents a parametric LCA approach, which allows architects to efficiently reduce the environmental impact of building designs. Methods First, the requirements for design-integrated LCA are analyzed. Then, assumptions to simplify the required data input are made and a parametric model is established. The model parametrizes all input, including building geometry, materials, and boundary conditions, and calculates the LCA in real time. The parametric approach possesses the advantage that input parameters can be adjusted easily and quickly. The architect has two options to improve the design: either through manually changing geometry, building materials, and building services, or through the use of an optimization solver. The parametric model was implemented in a parametric design software and applied using two cases: (a) the design of a new multi-residential building, and (b) retrofitting of a single-family house. Results and discussion We have successfully demonstrated the capability of the approach to find a solution with minimum environmental impact for both examples. In the first example, the parametric method is used to manually compare geometric design variants. The LCA is calculated based on assumptions for materials and building services. In the second example, evolutionary algorithms are employed to find the optimum combination of insulation material, heating system, and windows for retrofitting. We find that there is not one optimum insulation thickness, but many optima, depending on the individual boundary conditions and the chosen environmental indicator. Conclusions By incorporating a simplified LCA into the design process, the additional effort of performing LCA is minimized. The parametric approach allows the architect to focus on his main task of designing the building and finally makes LCA practically useful for design optimization. In the future, further performance analysis capabilities such as life cycle costing can also be integrated.  },

Twenty-three labtests with human subjects were conducted to provide summer cooling in a controlled-environment chamber. Overall thermal sensations and skin temperatures were collected and analyzed. Data collected as subjects stepped between the ambient environment and the controlled-environment workstation displayed hysteresis and overshooting. That facial skin temperature correlates with thermal sensation provides a causal explanation of the overshooting and hysteresis. Further, the minimum change on facial skin temperature required to register a just-noticeable difference on thermal sensation was calculated to explore the correlation between facial skintemperature and overall thermal senation. In conclusion, thermal sensation data provide a sound quantifiable foundation for comfortpositive non-uniform indoor thermal environments. Facial skin temperature explains thermal sensation’s changing characteristics during step changes in non-uniform thermal environments under varying local cooling methods.  },

    abstract={An analysis of material flows that also considers economic and social indicators has been performed at the national (Sweden) and urban scale (Stockholm and Gothenburg) to study the dynamics of resource use during the last two decades. A summary of policies related to resource consumption implemented at the EU, national and local scale is presented and their probable effects discussed based on empirical evidence. The resource consumption trends indicate that the implemented policies have failed to bring significant reductions in resource and energy throughput. Resource consumption has increased both in Sweden as a whole and in the studied cities. Moreover, the consumption of construction materials and electronics has grown exponentially, even when normalized by population. The few success stories are the absolute reduction in fossil fuel consumption achieved in Stockholm, building energy reduction by halve and complete abolishment of oil as the heating fuel in Sweden. The lifestyle characteristics that have an impact on resource consumption include high income, car ownership, large residential floor space, social movements and trends related to dietary choices. The consumption of electronics, textiles and cosmetic products was shown to have increased considerably. The same quantities of food are consumed, but the diet has changed. Waste generation by far outpaces improvements in recycling. In recycling, waste-to-energy is growing faster than material recycling, which impedes the development of a circular economy. The main limitation of the policies implemented to-date is that they only address efficiency of use, but do nothing to reduce the demand for resources. In addition, efforts have so far been restricted to energy consumption. The reality is that we must urgently reduce the consumption of all resources, not just fossil fuels. We call for greater concern and more action towards reducing nonfuel resource consumption.  },

This leads to extreme climate changes such as heat waves, rising sea-levels, changes in precipitation resulting in flooding and droughts, intense hurricanes, and degraded air quality, affect directly and indirectly the physical, social, and psychological health of humans. For that reasons, and in helping achieving the EU targets for 2020 and 2050, utilizing the available local renewable energy resources is needed. Although the current efficiency of PV system (PVs) is still relatively low and the capital cost is still high, the abundance of solar energy that strikes the Earth continuously makes the photovoltaic systems viable alternative. The current work, therefore, investigate the potential of utilizing solar energy for electricity generation in Europe. For this aim, a residential building in Landskrona, Sweden, was chosen as a case study. Solar World SW325 XL, which is a monocrystalline module, was selected as PV panel. A computer model was built to simulate grid-connected rooftop PV system in which the module elements are attached to the roof of the building. Sensitive analysis was carried out to test the robustness of the simulation results. Performed calculations show that there is a big potential to use PVs with 193 kWh/y electricity can be generated per square meter of PV. The payback time of the systems is 6 years with levelized cost of electricity is 10.3 C/kWh. Finally, artificial neural network (ANN)-base model was built to generate user-friendly formula that states the relationship between the NPV (net present value) of PVs and specific factors of interest. These factors, including electricity price, real interest rate, module price and inverter price, were chosen based on sensitivity analysis results. The study leaded to create a simple formula that can easily be used to estimate the NPV of PVs without use of complicated software.  },

    abstract={Thermal insulation material is an important component to reduce the environmental impact of buildings through the reduction of energy consumption in the operation phase. However, the material itself has embodied environmental impacts for the value it provides. Eco-efficiency is a method that quantifies relation between the environmental performance and the created value of a product system. This study investigated contributing factors of the eco-efficiency of thermal insulation materials to support decision making of material manufacturers. For the improvement of eco-efficiency, the assessment was made in two scopes: investigating the contributing factors of impact caused at production processes; and thermal performance through thermo-physical properties. For quantifying environmental impacts, cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) of each materials were made. The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) indicators used were ReCiPe H/A and global warming potential (GWP100a). For the assessment of production process, the inventories of the materials were assigned to six categories: heat, chemicals, electricity, transportation, raw materials and wastes. Among the assessed materials, contribution of electricity and heat within the production process was large for foam glass which had the highest potential to improve the eco-efficiency which was by factor 1.72. The analysis on relation between thermo-physical properties and eco-efficiency based on product data of the materials highlighted the importance of density as an indicator upon development and use. Although density often gains less attention, the finding suggested the effectiveness of improving the efficiency by having lower density without compensating the performance of the materials.  },

There is an opportunity to introduce energy efficiency measures in the renovation process, but in this process social aspects should also be taken into account. The purpose of this article is to provide an estimate of the economic and societal challenge of renovating and energy retrofitting the aging building stock. Building specific data on energy usage and previous renovation investments made in the multi-family dwellings in Gothenburg (N=5 098) is merged with data on tenure type and average income. Based on conducted energy retrofitting projects, costs are estimated for renovating and energy retrofitting multi-family dwellings that will reach the service life of 50 years before 2026. It is found that the pace of renovation needs to increase and that there is risk of increasing societal inequity due to rent increases in renovated buildings.  },

    journal={Proceedings of IEECB 2016},
    year={2016},
    abstract={Cities and their building stock represent one of the largest energy consumer groups and emitters of greenhouse gases (GHG). The urban building stock, including commercial buildings, offers a large and mostly untapped potential for energy efficiency improvement and GHG mitigation. Urban development, building stock alterations, and building technology measures therefore play a major role in setting the framework to exploit these potentials. A way to describe possible building stock development pathways is through building stock modelling. Although there have been many different bottom-up approaches that model energy demand and GHG emissions as well as other aspects of urban development, they have not been fully integrated and are not giving community energy planners, urban planners and decision makers enough information to influence the development in specific areas and technological fields. The building stock model presented in this paper gives the possibility to model energy supply and demand of both the residential and non-residential building stock at the scale of individual buildings, taking into account both heating and cooling demand (and other energy services) of buildings of various types and age classes. The model allows for tapping into spatially differentiated potentials and to balance demand and supply and renewable energy source (RES) potentials at a local scale (typically small-scale neighbourhoods and hectares) to guide the planning and development of sustainable cities. It is shown that commercial buildings in particular play a key role in initiating thermal energy network approaches (e.g. local low-temperature networks). Furthermore, the possibility to connect with other models e.g. through the Smart Urban Adapt (SUA) modelling platform, makes it possible to run a fully integrated, bottom-up simulation of different urban development scenarios and their impact on energy demand and GHG emissions taking into account all aspects of urban development. The SUA modelling platform provides a highly integrated model, taking into account energy, land use and urban design, in order to investigate the socio-economic drivers of energy consumption. The results of a concrete case study revealed the benefit of integrating energy efficient commercial buildings with district energy systems that allow for tapping local potentials of renewable energy sources, for both heating and cooling.  },

Currently, Urban Metabolism research focuses on the analysis of trends and transitions in different stages of city development, on developing classification systems and identification of metabolism profiles for urban areas.A novel framework for characterizing cities metabolism is provided using Urban Material Flow Accounting indicators as the basis. A Material Flow Accounting study is conducted for three cities in Sweden, from 1996 until 2011: Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo. Based on the urban metabolism characteristics framework, three distinct profiles are proposed: consumer-service; industrial; and transitioning.Stockholm's material needs are mainly for final consumption. When compared with the other two cities, material flows follow a more stable trend and have lower dependency on external systems due to the marginal production and export of goods.Gothenburg has the most resource intensive metabolism. It requires several times larger material inputs than the other two cities and produces much larger outputs, for benefit of the rest of the country and the world. Consequently, CO2 emissions are higher in Gothenburg.Malmo characteristics are more complex than Stockholm's with higher material needs in particular construction minerals. Its dependency on external flows is low, due to the fact that the economy and exports are based on domestically extracted Non-Metallic Minerals and Biomass.  },

Tests were conducted in Indonesia according to the National Standard SNI 1741, which is referring to ISO 834-1 and JIS A 1304. Different bamboo wall cross-sections were tested in specimens of 1050mm by 1050mm and evaluated according to insulation, integrity and mechanical resistance criteria. All specimens received a rating of 60 minutes resistance. The research provided a general understanding of the system response and highlighted critical variables of the wall system, which can be transformed into design recommendations.  },

    abstract={This paper highlights the need for a more inclusive and sustainable development of social housing in rapidly developing countries of Asia, Latin America, and Africa. At the example of the Philippines, a multi-perspective development process for a bamboo-based building systemis developed. Sustainability Assessment Criteria are defined through literature review, field observations and interviews with three stakeholder clusters: (1) Builders and users of traditional bamboo houses in the Philippines; (2) Stakeholders involved in using forest products for housing in other countries around the world; and (3) Stakeholders in the field of social housing in the Philippines. Through coding and sorting of data in a qualitative content analysis, 15 sustainability assessment criteria are identified clustered into the dimensions society, ecology, economy, governance, and technology. Guided by the sustainability criteria and four implementation strategies: (A) Research about and (B) Implementation of the building technology; (C) Participation and Capacity Buildingof Stakeholders; and (D) Sustainable Supply Chains, a strategic roadmap was created naming, in total, 28 action items. Through segmentation of the complex problem into these action items, the paper identifies one-dimensional methods leading to measurable, quantitative endpoints. In this way, qualitative stakeholder data is translated into quantitative methods, forming a pathway for a holistic assessment of the building technologies. A mid-point, multi-criteria, or pareto decision-making method comparing the 28 endpoints of the alternative to currently practiced conventional solutions is suggested as subject for further research. This framework paper is a contribution to how sustainable building practices can become more inclusive, incorporating the building stock of low-income dwellers. It bridges the gap between theoretical approach and practical applications of sustainability and underlines the strength of combining multi-dimensional development with stakeholder participation.  },

    abstract={Several building-stock modelling techniques have been employed to investigate the impact of energy efficiency measures (EEM), where the description of the building-stock generally consists of an age-type classification to specify building characteristics for groups of buildings. Such descriptions lack the appropriate level of detail to differentiate the potential for EEM within age groups. This paper proposes a methodology for building-stock description using building-specific data and measured energy use to augment an age-type building-stock classification. By integrating building characteristics from energy performance certificates, measured energy use and envelope areas from a 2.5D GIS model, the building-stock description reflects the heterogeneity of the building-stock. The proposed method is validated using a local building portfolio (N = 433) in the city of Gothenburg, where modelled results for space heating and domestic hot water are compared to data from measurements, both on an individual building level and for the entire portfolio. Calculated energy use based on the building-stock description of the portfolio differ less than 3% from measured values, with 42% of the individual buildings being within a 20% margin of measured energy use indicating further work is needed to reduce or quantify the uncertainty on a building level.  },

    abstract={Urban building-stocks must be transformed in order to reduce energy and resource use to achieve climate change mitigation targets. As the rate of renewal in the building-stock is low, energy efficiency measures need to be applied when renovation is being done. In order to evaluate renovation potential of the existing building stock on an urban level, a local approach is needed to understand challenges and possibilities associated with the transformation of the building-stock. By incorporating building-specific information and also considering the building in its setting, a more holistic view can be achieved. For this purpose, available databases containing building-specific information has been gathered and processed for the multi-family building stock of the city of Gothenburg. The available data is used to describe the energy performance of the stock, future renovation needs and is used to create a description of the stock used as input for calculating the energy demand. This thesis with appended papers shows that available data sources can be used to describe the characteristics of the stock on a building level while considering the location and context. Building attributes such as year of construction, value year, property owner, geometric data and energy performance certificates is spatially linked as well as used in modelling the energy performance of buildings to provide detailed and valuable information to policy makers, urban planners and property owners.  },

    abstract={International bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change or the United Nations agree in seeing the built environment as one of the key sectors to mitigate emissions. Cost abatement curves as generated by McKinsey list a number of technologies in the building sector, which are already cost effective and are together potentially allowing for carbon mitigations of 2,0-3,0 Gtons of CO2eq per annum. Despite being economically attractive as well as desirable from a climate change mitigation viewpoint, almost none of these technologies are massively upscaling. The European Union requires the individual member countries to implement measures to speed up energy efficiency in the building sector. Each country however is free on the exact way how to do so as long as its specific approach is in line with the general EU road-map. This paper assesses the effect of the implemented frameworks for France and Germany and draws conclusions regarding immediate and future phenomenon. Findings are that both countries have implemented holistic frameworks that include legal standards, financial incentives and market education. While the German setup focuses on systemic solutions though, France promotes a component based subsidy scheme. In both countries the refurbishment rate on a component level is substantially higher than for deep renovation with window exchange and roof refurbishment being the most commonly implemented ones. Component based measures are higher in France than in Germany, in some cases even meeting the aimed for 3% needed for a refurbishment of the complete building stock by 2050 on an EU level. In general however both countries fail to achieve refurbishment and renovation rates that enable them to stand up to the EU 2050 targets yet, indicating that the market barrier and mechanisms have to be monitored and understood better to implement massive up-scaling of energy efficient technologies.  },

Sustainability assessments of transport infrastructures are slowly increasing around the world and the practices vary considerably. Current applied methods rely basically on Environmental impact assessment (EIA) or Strategic environmental assessment (SEA) procedures, which in turn often contain one or more procedures such as Cost-benefit analysis (CBA), Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and Life cycle analysis (LCA). In several countries legal frameworks exist for sustainability assessment of transport infrastructures, for instance the EIA and SEA Directives in Europe. However, limitations of EIA and SEA are acknowledged in literature, although a few studies report improved sustainability assessments. Suggestions are also made in literature to introduce wider perspectives in order to consider sustainability aspects more properly, e.g. the inclusion of social indicators. Assessments aiming at the consideration of sustainability aspects and influencing the strategic planning of these complex systems are rare and methods are in their infancy. Key issues and knowledge gaps that are in need of being further addressed by research include the requirement to cover wider spatial and temporal scales, the consideration of cumulative and indirect effects and a more effective incorporation of stakeholders. Other highlighted issues are inadequate monitoring of project outcomes and the general lack of combination of knowledge from different knowledge fields.  },

    abstract={Concerning the resource depletion and global warming, the realization of sustainable constructions is crucial because the building industry has a big impact on the greenhouse gas emission. Recently the interest in the buildings in subtropical regions has been growing due tothe high growth rate of their urbanized areas. From the view point of building physics, those regions are very challenging because they have both heating and cooling demand. Also the prediction of indoor air humidity is acquiring a greater interest concerning the envelopedurability, the comfort and the energy consumption, which is very relevant to such regions. Meanwhile, there is a need of developing a new construction system and its design method for subtropical regions since it is inappropriate to simply use the established construction systems for cold regions which have only heating demand.Based on the transient hydrothermal model of the envelope and the whole building heat and moisture balance model taking into account the moisture buffering by hygroscopic interior materials, the authors have developed an envelope system and its insulation optimization scheme which considers lifetime environmental impact, lifetime cost, durability, users’ behaviour and local climate. The envelope consists of natural materials such as wood and clay and thus allows the moderate transfer of the water vapour in both directions i.e. from exterior to interior and from interior to exterior. A detached house with this system was realized in Ohmihachiman (central Japan) in June 2013 and the indoor temperature and humidity havebeen monitored at several points. The measured indoor climate was analysed and it was revealed that 1. the indoor climate in summer has a certain improvement potential and 2. the indoor climate in winter is satisfying. As the monitoring of electricity generation by the photovoltaic panels and the electricityconsumption of the whole house has showed a positive balance (more generation than consumption), it is suggested to either use the cooling radiator more actively or install an active dehumidifier into the mechanical ventilation system to provide a more agreeable indoor climate in the summer. The former recommendation will be implemented in summer 2015 and its impact on the comfort and energy consumption will be further analysed.  },

We performed a life cycle assessment and used thermal simulation to quantify operational energy demand and to account for differences in thermal inertia of building mass. Twenty-eight input parameters, affecting operation, design, material, and exogenic building properties were sampled in a Monte Carlo analysis. To determine sensitivity, we calculated the correlation between each parameter and the resulting life cycle inventory and impact assessment scores. Parameters affecting operational energy demand and energy conversion are the most influential for the building’s total environmental performance. For climate change, electricity mix, ventilation rate, heating system, and construction material rank the highest. Thermal inertia results in an average 2-6% difference in heat demand. Non-renewable cumulative energy demand of wooden buildings is 18% lower, compared to a massive variant. Total cumulative energy demand is comparable. The median climate change impact is 25% lower, including end-of-life material credits and 22% lower, when credits are excluded. The findings are valid for small offices and residential buildings in Switzerland and regions with similar building culture, construction material production, and climate.  },

This study investigates the case of the recent technology change within television sets (TVs) and monitors, its impact on the generation of WEEE, and the implications for the recycling industry. In particular, material flow analysis for the time series of 1996-2014 for TVs and monitors by type of technology (CRT, Plasma and LCD) in physical units is combined with empirical data on product lifespans. The number of consumed TVs and monitors has grown exponentially. As a result, despite a 3-fold reduction in the weight of the products, the weight of the corresponding WEEE is also growing exponentially. Out with the old, out with the new - a peak in VVEEE from both CRT and flatscreen displays is expected during 2014-2020, due tothe simultaneous obsolesce of the last wave of CRT products and the short-lived flat-screen products that substituted the CRTs. The lifespans of LCD and LED TVs were found to be three times shorter than of the CRT TVs, with many TVs discarded while still functional. This is the consequence of two events - replacement of the CRT TVs in combination with lifestyle purchases of TVs, i.e. the premature replacement of flat-screen displays with new sets with extra-large screens and/or new features. The throughput of TVs and monitors consumed has been estimated annually from 2014 until 2040, by quantity and type of device, as well as by component and material type. The annual economic value of the corresponding secondary materials, by material type, has also been estimated. The point in time when the final disposal of CRT products is likely to take place has been identified and should be noted by the recycling industry. Among the important contributions of this study to the accounting and predicting of amounts and types of WEEE are the lifespan distributions, size and weight distributions, and material composition for TVs and monitors of different technology. Directions for method application in other countries are given.  },

In the three cases, absolute reductions in CO2 emissions by about 20% were observed, energy consumption per capita decreased, while gross domestic product (GDP) per capita grew. The energy consumption of the residential and public sectors decreased drastically, while the transport energy consumption is still growing steadily. Decoupling of the economy as a whole (i.e., including materials) is not yet happening at any scale. The domestic material consumption (DMC) continues to increase, in parallel with the GDP. The rate of increase for DMC is slower than that for GDP in both Stockholm and Sweden as a whole (i.e., relative decoupling). The metabolism of the cities does not replicate the national metabolism, and the two cities each have their own distinct metabolism profiles. As a consequence, policy implications for each of the case studies were suggested. In general, because of the necessarily different roles of the two cities in the national economy, generic resource productivity benchmarks, such as CO2 per capita, should be avoided in favor of sectorial benchmarks, such as industry, transport, or residential CO2 per capita. In addition, the share of the city impacts caused by the provision of a service for the rest of the country, such as a port, could be allocated to the national economy.  },

    abstract={Circular economy (CE) principles can be applied at different scales: from materials to products, from individual supply chains to industries, from cities to national and transnational economies. In order to design a CE at any scale, a system approach is needed to describe and analyse the current situation and to model and implement the transformations required. In this paper we show how Urban Metabolism (UM) research can support the design of CE in cities. Urban metabolism considers resource consumption and environmental pressure of urban areas in a systemic way. The Urban Metabolism Group at Chalmers is developing three alleys of research: UM description, analysis and sustainable UM design. Findings from each of these may inform CE design by for example: quantifying resource flows at the product and material levels and with respect to industries and other sectors using them; identifying possible links between stakeholders with suitable materials and infrastructures; connecting material flows with life cycle impacts for multidimensional priority setting; depicting the drivers of material flows; and modelling policy effects on material flows. In this way, urban metabolism research can provide a comprehensive framework to investigate the pathways to circularity at both the urban and regional level.  },

    abstract={IntroductionMulti-criteria assessment (MCA) is a methodology that supports making decisions by capturing multiple aspects. Building thermal insulation materials are products that have various properties including mechanical strength, fire resistance, acoustic performance, hygrothermal property and so on. In addition, Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) of the materials is gaining its importance with the growing interest on the design of sustainable buildings. However, there is limited number of studies which dealt with the selection of the material considering multiple aspects. This study applied MCA on common insulation materials (stone wool and expanded polystyrene (EPS)) to examine its effectiveness when selecting more environmentally friendly material.Experimental/Theoretical StudyAmong various MCA methods, the study applied analytical hierarchy process (AHP). AHP is one of the most common approaches for MCA that performs pair-wise comparison between different choices against each criterion[1]. AHP integrates the compared results into single normalized scale as an output. Upon integration, weighting which reflects the relative importance of the criteria can be made. The study applied AHP for thermal insulation materials to be used for vertical walls by taking technical and environmental criteria: thermal conductivity (TC), compression strength (CS), fire resistance (FR) and global warming potential (GWP) via LCIA of the materials. Case studies were made in five scenarios with weighting of each of three criteria as top priority and no weighting which is shown in Table 1.CasesPrioritiesResultCase 1GWP > TC = CS = FRSW > EPSCase 2TC > CS = FR = GWPSW > EPSCase 3CS > FR = GWP = TCEPS > SWCase 4FR > GWP = TC = CSSW > EPSCase 5GWP = TC = CS = FRSW > EPSTable 1. Summary of priority of seven cases and their resultsResults and DiscussionFor Case 3 where compression strength was top priority, EPS was superior to Stone wool. With all the other cases, stone wool was preferable over EPS. Moreover, stone wool outperformed EPS even without weighting. This suggests that in contrary to conventional design practice, the inclusion of LCIA results in AHP encourages users to select more environmentally friendly material between the two for the investigated value criteria. As the weighting showed its importance upon selection of sustainable insulation materials, further investigation on the weighting scheme is necessary. ConclusionThe study applied MCA for assessing two typical building thermal insulation materials that took environmental and technical aspects into account. The result showed the effectiveness and challenge of using AHP for including LCIA results upon choosing sustainable insulation materials. Moreover, further consideration for compression strength is also necessary as it may require restrictions such as threshold value depending on specific building details, codes etc. In order to allow this MCA fully applicable for building design, further improvements on the method is necessary.Reference[1] Huang, I.B., J.

    abstract={Different users and investors´ project preferences, often lead to trade-offs during the early design phase of a project. Currently, decisions of design options and their technical measures are mainly reduced to an instantaneously assessed criterion (i.e. energy efficiency) within the sustainability assessment of buildings. Due to criteria interdependency, the current linear applied approach used in building certification neglects criteria trade-offs and is therefore only partly suitable for holistic building improvement processes. In order to fulfil stakeholder interests on the one hand and a high sustainability performance on the other, it is crucial to identify appropriate design measures. Based on the Austrian building certification system ÖGNI/DGNB, we applied a systemic approach for building sustainability-improvement, using a case study of a public office building in Graz, Austria. The main part of the study describes the important steps required for the systemic optimization of building sustainability. The method applied in this study allows the quantification of the relative influence and the identification of the individual optimization potential of design options on each single assessment criterion. The proposed systemic approach clearly demonstrated the improvement potential of the currently most developed building certification system considering the interdependency between the individual criteria.  },

    year={2015},
    abstract={An infrastructure system – here, the industrial ecology of Gothenburg — is more important for society than we usually credit it for (cf. Technology is society made durable, Latour 1990) and is taken for granted by most inhabitants. Gothenburg is an unusually well-developed and interconnected infrastructure system. The first district heating facility was put in operation in 1952. Soon enough, waste was re-used and recycled into energy, into both electricity and heat. With time, more varied materials and sources became integrated into the system to also produce biogas and compost. The project makes a historiographic description of how the industrial ecology of the Gothenburg city region developed since the Gothenburg technical environmental flow system is unique in size, age, diversity of flows and functions. The study describes environmental flows and their actors in a networked organization. The focus on interconnectivity of the different actors, flows and sectors of Gothenburg requires the combination of several theoretical fields. Such theoretical fields include Networked Learning, which takes a relational stance in which learning takes place both in relation to others, and in relation to learning resources (Dirckinck-Homfeld et al., 2009); STS (Science Technology and Society), which study how technical innovation are affected by social, political and cultural values, and how these innovation affect, in turn, political, social and cultural values; (Joerges & Novotny, 2003); and Urban Metabolism, which uses models to facilitate the description and analysis of the flows of the energy and materials within cities, such as Material Flow Analysis of a city, and provides a metaphorical framework to study the interactions of natural and human systems in specific regions. Preliminary findings will be presented.  },

    abstract={Energy usage in the Swedish building stock has changed significantly the last 20 years. The target of reducing the Green Houses Gas (GHG) emissions by 40% till 2020 seems reachable through improved energy efficiency and a switch to less GHG emitting heat sources. The goal of GHG neutrality by 2050 will however require further initiatives. This paper is primarily a review of the contemporary Swedish building stock state and research. Different research bodies, such as government research institutes, universities, and companies, have different financing and foci. They present their analyses the built environment differently. This paper creates a structure amongst these actors by dividing them in groups and by identifying topics where there are different positions held by researchers and practitioners in the fields related to building stock. Data from Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) is used to display how energy usage varies depending on building age. This gives an indication on how the building stock is developing and what possibilities there are to reach environmental targets.  },

    abstract={Abstract The EU directive to create Energy Performance Certificates (EPC) for all buildings was implemented in Sweden as a tool to advise building owners on possible improvements and to give energy efficiency visible market value. The Swedish EPCs include measured energy usage. Currently 82% of the buildings have EPCs; this database makes it possible to create overview and to validate models of the building stock in an unprecedented high detail. However, the process of issuing Swedish EPCs has received criticism from real estate agents, real estate owners, Energy Experts, and Boverket, the national agency responsible for EPC data collection. In order to use the EPC data for describing the building stock it is necessary to assess and remediate the data quality. This has been done by merging the EPC data with databases of the Housing and Urban Development office and one of the larger real estate companies in Sweden, Riksbyggen. The Swedish EPC specific area measurement, Atemp, is found to vary according to methods of derivation. The method of estimating Atemp is improved using a stepwise regression model (R2 = 0.979). This method can be applied to subsets of EPCs depending on the intended way of describing the building stock.  },

    year={2015},
    abstract={In developed countries, the residential and commercial building stock account for a considerable share of final energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Building stock modeling is an established tool to assess different development paths of buildings on city, region or country level. Current building stock models (BSM) as well as previous works of the authors, however, lack a holistic approach that take technological, economic and ecological factors into account on an individual building scale. There are, therefore, limitations in the conclusions that can be drawn. In order to increase their significance, current research shows trends towards spatial differentiation, representation of individual building and owners as well as economic decision modeling. However, no model combines all three aspects in a more holistic approach. This paper describes a novel approach which combines spatial differentiation with building specific heat demand modeling and an economic decision simulation. The model developed combines a building specific engineering model with a micro-economic discrete choice approach. Using spatial building data, the engineering model calculates space heat and hot water energy demand on a building level. The alteration of the building refurbishment state is modeled using a discrete choice approach to simulate the decision process of building owners of building envelope refurbish and/or to substitute the heating system. Due to the building specific approach, the decision model is able to take into account building specific information such as size, geometry, room temperature, investment, maintenance and energy costs and achievable energy savings as well as other factors such as local potentials and restrictions on the use of renewable energy. In a case study of the city of Zürich we demonstrate the feasibility and strengths of the new model approach. The results demonstrate that modeling space heating demand on an individual building scale yields specific heat demand distribution across building clusters (and not simply in average values as in other models). The building level approach enables the model to deliver differentiated results of the heat demand development for the whole building stock, building types building periods or spatially distributed as shown in the results.  },

    abstract={Purpose Growing awareness of the environmental performanceof construction products and buildings brings aboutthe need for a suitable method to assess their environmentalperformance. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become awidely recognised and accepted method to assess the burdensand impacts throughout the life cycle. This LCA-based information may be in the form of environmental product declarations (EPD) or product environmental footprints (PEF), based on reliable and verifiable information. All of these use LCA to quantify and report several environmental impact categorie and may also provide additional information. To better understand on the one hand existing EPD programmes (EN 15804) for each country and on the other the recent developments in terms of EU reference document (e.g. PEF), the authors decided to write this review paper based on the outcomes of the EPD workshop that was held prior to SB13 Graz conference.Methods This paper presents the state of the art in LCA and an overview of the EPD programmes in five European countries(Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland) based on the workshop in the first part and a comprehensive description and comparison of the PEF method and EN 15804 in the second part. In the last part, a general conclusion will wrap up the findings and results will provide a further outlook on future activities.Results and discussion The high number of EPD programmesunderlines the fact that there is obviously a demand for assessments of the environmental performance of construction materials.In the comparison between and experiences of thedifferent countries, it can be seen that more similarities than differences exist. A comparison between PEF and EPD shows differences, e.g. LCIA impact categories and recyclingmethodology. Conclusions Independent of raising awareness of the construction material environmental performance, the existence of somany environmental claims calls for clarification andharmonisation. Additionally, construction materials beingassessed in the voluntary approaches have to follow theharmonised approach following the principles of the EuropeanConstruction Products Regulation (regulated) not to foster barriers of trade. The authors therefore highly appreciate the most recent activities of the sustainability of construction works (CEN/TC 350 committee http://portailgroupe.afnor.fr/public_espacenormalisation/CENTC350/index.html) currently workingon these issues at the EU level. Finally, the LCA community is further encouraged to increase the background life cycleinventory data and life cycle inventory modelling as well as the meaningfulness of certain environmental impact categories, such as toxicity, land use, biodiversity and resource usage.  },

The method uses regularly available statistics on import, industrial production and export of batteries and battery-containing electric and electronic equipment (EEE). To promote method use by other scholars with no access to such data, several empirically results and their trends over time, for different types of batteries occurrence among the EEE types are provided. The information provided by the method can be used to: identify drivers of battery consumption; study the dynamic behavior of battery flows - due to technology development, policies, consumers behavior and infrastructures. The method is exemplified by the study of battery flows in Sweden for years 1996-2013. The batteries were accounted, both in units and weight, as primary and secondary batteries; loose and integrated; by electrochemical composition and share of battery use between different types of EEE. Results show that, despite a fivefold increase in the consumption of rechargeable batteries, they account for only about 14% of total use of portable batteries. Recent increase in digital convergence has resulted in a sharp decline in the consumption of primary batteries, which has now stabilized at a fairly low level. Conversely, the consumption of integrated batteries has increased sharply. In 2013, 61% of the total weight of batteries sold in Sweden was collected, and for the particular case of alkaline manganese dioxide batteries, the value achieved 74%. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, the impact of the input data quality on the main MFA indicators is analyzed and the sources and extent of uncertainties for different spatial scales are listed. The types, origin, and extent of the errors are described in detail and several imputation methods are explained and evaluated. By introducing a novel approach to account measurement errors in data sets with very few details on the measurement errors, this article aims at contributing to the development of a standardized method to account for the uncertainty in MFA studies. This study uses the time series of MFA data for 1996-2011 at three spatial scalesnationwide (Sweden), regional (the Stockholm Region), and metropolitan (Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmo)to determine how propagation of measurement errors affects the MFA results. The following MFA indicators were studied: direct material input; domestic processed output; and domestic material consumption. Generally, availability decreased as the spatial scale was lowered, whereas data errors increased. In the specific case of Sweden, the data on freight transport by rail and on waste produced by economic activities at the regional and metropolitan level should be improved.  },

    abstract={The greater proportion of global emission production and resource consumption takes place in cities. Innovations are needed to reduce the use of resources and emissions within the building sector, but the sector is slow to innovate and integrate new technology, and high-impact city-scale interventions are difficult, owing to the complexity of factors. In this paper, a district-scale approach is projected to be an effective way to invoke change within the built environment of a city system, exemplified through the European Union-funded Climate-KIC Smart Sustainable Districts (SSD) Flagship Project in Gothenburg, Sweden. The SSD aims to reach Factor 10 reductions in the use of resources within the Johanneberg District. A co-creation environment is proposed to incorporate technology innovation for sustainable living into the district, and ultimately city, level, which will be realised through the HSB Living Lab Project, a living lab infrastructure under construction on the campus of Chalmers University of Technology. Interventions to reduce the use of resources at a district-scale systems level in combination with real-world testing and creation of innovative technology within living lab environments have high potential to effect a reduction in city system resource consumption and emissions. This pilot stage proposition will be tested through the implementation of both SSD and HSB Living Lab projects.  },
