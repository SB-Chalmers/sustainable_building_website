Leonardo Rosado is currently an Associate Professor at Chalmers University of Technology and has been working at the University since 2012. More than fifteen years of experience in Industrial Ecology, in particular the Urban Metabolism and Circular Economy fields, using holistic approaches to develop methods to study resource flows and stocks of cities and regions. The research he has been developing is focused on three main topics that together provide a solid scientific characterization of the built environment, while understanding the main causes of environmental impacts and support the design of circular economy strategies that can minimize impacts in various dimensions.
