Luca is a PhD student at the division of Building Technology. His work integrates two research fields: material stock and construction management. He uses material stock results to investigate the logistical and environmental implications of a wide-scale circularization of the construction industry. He combines approaches and tools such as material flow analysis, life cycle assessment and geographical information system.
