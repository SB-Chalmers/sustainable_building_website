Haitham is a focused PhD student in Environmental Economics, backed by a solid foundation in Civil and Architectural Engineering. His initial research revolved around Building Information Modeling (BIM)-based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tools, and he pioneered novel, gamified methods to impart LCA knowledge to engineering students. Now a recipient of the prestigious Marie-Curie fellowship, Haitham's primary research explores Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Design for Disassembly (DfD) of buildings. This work strives to mitigate environmental harm and foster sustainable building methodologies. Despite his intensive research schedule, Haitham dedicates a considerable amount of his time to software development, crafting tools in Python and C# that aim to streamline and enhance the fields of environmental economics and sustainable architecture.
