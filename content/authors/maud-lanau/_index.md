Maud’s research focuses on the sustainability potential offered by the extensive quantities of secondary resources stocked as buildings and infrastructures. She uses systems thinking to investigate how to reduce environmental impacts of built environments while still providing sufficient services key to human wellbeing. Working within the paradigms of industrial ecology, socioeconomic metabolism, and circular economy, she combines approaches and tools such as material stock and flow analysis, carbon accounting, geographical information system, remote sensing, and stakeholder collaboration.
