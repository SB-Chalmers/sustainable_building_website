# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: Sjouke Beemsterboer seeks to develop a new methodological approach in order to reduce the complexity of a full LCA of residential and office buildings while maintaining an acceptable degree of validity in the expected results. This new methodological approach will be developed in collaboration with partners in the construction industry, and will provide guidance especially in the early design stages of a planning process.

Sjouke Beemsterboer seeks to develop a new methodological approach in order to reduce the complexity of a full LCA of residential and office buildings while maintaining an acceptable degree of validity in the expected results. This new methodological approach will be developed in collaboration with partners in the construction industry, and will provide guidance especially in the early design stages of a planning process.

In other projects, Sjouke focuses on building information standards and on innovation practices of middle managers in construction organisations.

Sjouke draws mainly upon expertise from science and technology studies (STS) and sustainability assessment methodology.
