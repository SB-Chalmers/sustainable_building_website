Gothenburg, November 27th.

As a prequal to the DTCC conference, Alex Gonzales Caceres organised a workshop about visualisation, auralisation, and the DTCC platform at the Visual Areana at Lindholmen Science Park. 30 international participants joined for the four-hour workshop. Alexander Hollberg moderated the afternoon that was highly appreciated by the participants.

Adaptation of Colour Scales for Inclusive Information Visualization in Urban 3D-Models
Presenters: Beata Stahre Wästberg, Monica Billger, Jessica Lundin (Chalmers University of Technology)
This workshop aimed to address the challenges of effective visualization in digital twins for urban planning, emphasizing the importance of a shared understanding among stakeholders. The focus was on color scales used to represent abstract parameters in 3D models, specifically targeting the visualization of invisible factors such as noise and social consequences. The discussion was based on recent research examining the use of color scales for information visualization, considering the appropriateness of colors for users with regular color vision and different types of color deficiencies.

Challenges in the Computation and Interpretation of Noise Heatmaps in Urban Environments
Presenter: Jens Ahrens (Chalmers University of Technology)
Jens delved into the complexities of visualizing noise in urban environments using heatmaps. These heatmaps, which color-code noise levels on different surfaces, present challenges in both computation and interpretation. The presentation highlighted the difficulties in computing noise levels due to the scale of urban scenarios and the potential for misinterpretation of resulting heatmaps. Attendees gained insights into reliable deductions from visual inspections and the uncertainties associated with heatmap interpretation.

Unlocking the Power of Digital Twins through Data Visualization
Presenters: Daniel Sjölie (DTCC, University West) & Orfeas Eleftheriou (DTCC, Chalmers University of Technology)
This session explored methods and tools to enhance the effectiveness of digital twins through data visualization in the Unreal Engine environment. The presenters covered topics such as an open-source visualization plugin for multidisciplinary scientific data and demonstrated a streamlined workflow for terrain model generation enriched with simulation data. The versatility of these tools was showcased in both virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) environments.

Building the Digital Twin Cities Platform; Current Status and Future Development
Presenter: Vasilis Naserentin (DTCC, Chalmers University of Technology), Jens Olsson (DTCC, CIT)
Vasilis and Jens provided an in-depth overview of ongoing efforts to construct a comprehensive digital twin platform for urban environments. The presentation highlighted the current state of the platform, key features, and challenges encountered during development. Attendees gained insights into the transformative potential of digital twins in reshaping urban planning and management. The session concluded with a workshop allowing participants to experience the Digital Twin Cities platform hands-on and engage in collaborative discussions on potential applications and improvements.
