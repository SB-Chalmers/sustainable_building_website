![Material flows in and out of road structures and pavements between 1980 and 2017. Underlying data for Figure 3 are available in a table entitled “Figure 3” of Supporting Information S2](featured.jpg)
The Journal of Industrial Ecology shared the article "Machine learning-based stocks and flows modeling of road infrastructure" by [Babak Ebrahimi](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3086-0816), [Leonardo Rosado]() and Holger Wallbaum.
The paper introduces a new method using machine learning applied to material flow analysis as an alternative to achetype modeling to study road infrastructure.
[Holger Wallbaum](https://sb.chalmers.se/author/holger-wallbaum/) says this was the first attempt to apply machine learning based methods to MFA but is confident in developing this method further with SB's newest colleague, [Maud Lanau](https://sb.chalmers.se/author/maud-lanau/) .
