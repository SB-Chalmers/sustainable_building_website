We are now welcoming abstracts for the second Nordic Build-LCA PhD forum held at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg on May 15th and 16th, 2023. This forum aims to provide PhD students working with LCA and the built environment the opportunity to openly discuss ongoing research with peers. 

The participants should be registered PhD students with a relation to the Nordics. Selected PhD students present their PhD topic or a certain aspect of it in less than 20 minutes. Then there will be time for a detailed discussion. For each presentation, two students will be assigned beforehand to prepare and moderate questions. In contrast to scientific conferences, where the focus lies on showing polished results, this more informal setting enables open discussions about challenging topics and obstacles encountered on the way. The goal should be to have a student-student exchange with no or limited input from professors and senior researchers. The scope of the forum is LCA and related topics, such as LCC, circular economy, etc.

Abstract submission deadline: February 21st   

Acceptance notification: March 31st
