The Built-LCA Hackathon aims to explore the effective use of databases and develop a flexible communication system between Grasshopper and data sources of different resolutions. The primary challenge is to analyse the DeCarbonAIte Data workflow, which involves computing, storing, and presenting results, while incorporating databases into the process. It is crucial to consider that databases are not static entities; they require constant updates with new data or restructuring.\
\
**Objective**\
Devise a database and communication system that seamlessly integrates within the workflow, eliminating the need for manual procedures. This integration will enable the technology to connect with larger systems, such as Digital Twin, and enhance overall efficiency and effectiveness.
