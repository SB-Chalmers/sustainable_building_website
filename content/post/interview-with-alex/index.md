This week we sat down with **Alexander Hollberg**, the Research Area Leader for Sustainable Built Environments, to discuss his current projects, research achievements, and insights for early-career researchers. From leading projects in the Computational Design theme, Alexander shares his thoughts on how digital methods are shaping the future of sustainable architecture and urban planning.

**Could you tell us about the different projects you are currently leading or involved in within Sustainable Built Environments?**

> I lead several projects in the Computational Design theme of our research area. Overall, we are interested in how digital methods can support design and decision-making for a sustainable built environment. Different projects look at different approaches to answering this question, ranging from augmented and virtual reality to multi-domain simulations using digital twins. I am also acting as research area leader.

**Looking back, what are some key achievements or milestones from your research that you're most proud of?**

> That is a difficult question. I am still proud of my [PhD thesis](https://www.db-thueringen.de/receive/dbt_mods_00037445) that I thought nobody would ever read but that seemed to have inspired others to use LCA for building optimization in early design stages. I am also proud of our collaboration with Universeum, where we provide different data visualizations—not because of the research itself, but because it attracts lots of interest from citizens visiting the exposition.

*A parametric method for building design optimization based on Life Cycle Assessment*

**How do your projects contribute to addressing global challenges in sustainability and the built environment?**

> Our projects mainly focus on environmental aspects by aiming to lower resource consumption and environmental impacts from the construction and operation of buildings. We also have a few projects that take social and economic aspects into account.

**What advice do you have for early-career researchers looking to make a meaningful impact in this field?**

> Follow your interests, be creative in how you address challenges, be open to criticism, and share your research results with the world.

**When you're not working on research, how do you like to spend your time or unwind?**

> Work and my kids already occupy 26 hours a day, but if I have the chance, I go for a run in [Ängårdsbergen](https://www.goteborg.com/platser/anggardsbergens-naturreservat). I always feel refreshed and more creative afterward. I also like bouldering and, in the summer, wingfoiling because I can completely detach from work.
