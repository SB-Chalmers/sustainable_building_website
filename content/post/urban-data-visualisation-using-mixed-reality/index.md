The Twinable project by the Chalmers University of Technology uses mixed reality to project urban data onto a 3D model of Gothenburg created by Universeum Vislab, providing interactive visualisations that offer a new perspective on the city. Through Twinable, researchers at Chalmers University have created interactive visualisations that allow users to explore various urban data sets in an engaging and informative way. Using mixed reality technology, users can now see urban data come to life, providing a whole new perspective on the city. Twinable has applications in urban planning and transportation and offers an exciting new way to explore Gothenburg.
