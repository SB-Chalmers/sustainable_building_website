Divia Jimenez Encarnacion recently defended her licentiate thesis, that involves generating knowledge on consumption and sharing of household goods to support the governance of sustainable sharing in the city of Gothenburg. 



Her findings indicate that in Gothenburg there is a general willingness to change current consumption patterns  and a high level of interest in sharing, though interest changes depending on sharing activities. The thesis also identifies demographic factors such as gender, age, and education level that significantly shape consumption and sharing; and household goods such as clothes, furniture and tools that are potential hotspots for increasing   For specific product categories, patterns were identified where products such as clothes presented higher consumption but lower engagement in sharing, and vice versa for tools and leisure equipment. In the geographical analysis, the maximum consumption levels were seen for clothes (in units) and furniture and household equipment (in kg). The qualitative analysis supported positive perceptions of the SE, emphasizing circularity, resource conservation, and cost-saving benefits, but also highlighted challenges to overcome, such as practicality.\
Â \
These results provide actionable insights for governing the SE while contributing to reducing the fragmentation in the literature regarding the sustainability value of the SE.
