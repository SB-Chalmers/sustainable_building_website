title: Occupant well-being and productivity in sustainable office buildings
subtitle: A multidisciplinary study on the key factors of indoor environmental quality
summary: The project aims to develop advanced indoor environmental quality IEQ in sustainable office buildings promoting occupant comfort, health, and productivity by identifying key factors and revealing causal relations from evidence-based studies. A national dataset will be aggregated from the office buildings in Sweden by physical measurement and subjective survey.

People have been endeavoring to build habitable indoor environment as more than 80% of our live are spent indoors which is a vital part to achieve a good life. During the past decades, growing researches have shown that indoor environmental quality IEQ has a significant impact on occupant well-being and productivity in office buildings. This research program aims to develop advanced indoor environmental quality IEQ in sustainable office buildings promoting occupant comfort, health, and productivity by identifying key factors and revealing causal relations from evidence-based studies. A national dataset will be aggregated from the office buildings in Sweden by physical measurement and subjective survey. A series of statistical methods will be applied to achieve a reliable data analysis. A cross-country analysis will be conducted using the dataset from Switzerland with the collected 27 office buildings and 2000 responses to verify the results and further examine the application of the finding in a wider context. The findings will contribute to the research gap of key factors and causal paths of indoor environmental quality regarding a multidisciplinary perspective. Ultimately, the research project will promote the national occupantsâ€™ well-being and health in the work environment and positively contribute to the UN 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
