The construction sector is a major consumer of materials, contributing significantly to climate change and generating vast amounts of waste. Despite plastics’ widespread presence in buildings—such as insulation, floor covering, and packaging for all kinds of construction products, they are often overlooked in these environmental discussions because they are lightweight and less visible. 

In fact, the construction industry is the world’s second-largest consumer of plastics. Most plastics are derived from fossil fuels, and their production, along with the incineration of plastic waste, releases substantial carbon dioxide emissions, exacerbating climate change. Improving plastic circularity in construction is therefore crucial. While the sector has made progress in using secondary plastics, its recycling rate remains at just 25%, lagging behind other plastic application sectors like packaging and agriculture. This low recycling rate is primarily due to a lack of incentives across the value chain.

This project aims to improve plastic waste management at the construction sites to improve the plastic circularity, bringing the climate incentives into focus.
