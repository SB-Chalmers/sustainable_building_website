The main goal of the project is to mainstream holistic life cycle performance optimisation in early design stages of buildings to save energy and greenhouse gas emissions. All performance optimisation will follow a life cycle perspective. Existing tools will be evaluated, adapted and combined for efficient and holistic assessment in the Swedish context. Different user interfaces and visualisations including virtual reality will be tested. The outcome will be a set of flexible workflows that can easily be integrated into the design process and easily enable architects and designers to make use of computational optimisers. The workflows will be published as an online open access library to ensure accessibility for all designers. Next to the scientific evaluation of different optimisation workflows, practical guidelines and tutorials will be developed and disseminated with partners from practice.
