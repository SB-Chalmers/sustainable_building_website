The aim of this project is to develop a Regional Energy Demand Analysis Portal (REDAP) together with the partner countries Austria, Ireland and Sweden based on local and regional Need-owners demands. The focus is on the one hand on piloting, validating and demonstrating how digital technologies can be used to improve existing planning decision for Smart Energy Systems and on the other hand on analysing and better understanding the energy demand related to building stocks and transports to facilitate cross sectoral, holistic approaches.  
REDAP is expected to improve the speed and focus of planning, policy making and incentivisation of building and transportation infrastructure towards a higher share of renewables and being more energy efficient. This will enable regions and local communities to move towards efficient, sustainable and decarbonized energy systems, in line with the EU 2030 and 2050 targets as well as the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
