subtitle: The Carbon Resource Energy and Adaption Toolbox Europe
date: 2022-07-04 00:00:00
summary: The Carbon Resource Energy and Adaption Toolbox Europe (CREATE), is a
  comprehensive modelling and data toolbox that can overcome problems such as -
  How, and at which costs can ambitious climate change mitigation goals be
  reached? How can urban planning be developed while simultaneously tackling
  climate change? How can the long-term economic and environmental performance
  of the building stock be optimized? How to plan electricity, gas, and thermal
  networks to suit future energy demand and the existing urban topology?

### About Create

<div>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <img src="featured.jpg" width= 400px style="padding: 15px; float: right">
    CREATE project aims at supporting urban transformation processes towards the circular economy by making an inventory of the existing material stocks within urban construction, developing reliable scenarios for future expected material flows, and providing governance arrangements on how to approach the circular economy transition. The project will focus on the largest urban infrastructures and communal assets, namely buildings, municipal roads, water, and wastewater pipes. A truly transdisciplinary consortium will work with a mixed research design that integrates quantitative modelling with qualitative study and design of governance aspects. The project will further improve already existing, validated, and applied tools and arrangements and combine them with new digitalization technologies to inform decision-makers and enable a circular built environment. 
    This will be achieved by engaging with a wide range of stakeholders in a co-creation process with three urban living labs and six fellow cities in five countries, which will result in numerous capacity building moments throughout the entire project. A thorough analysis of best practices of cities steering the circular economy transition together with new governance interventions will result in concrete proposals of tailored governance arrangements for the participating cities including a concrete proposal for an upscaling strategy for Europe.

## Urban LivingLabs

### About LivingLabs

JPI Urban Europe definition:  

<div style="text-align: justify">A forum for innovation, applied to the development of new products, systems, services and processes in an urban area; employing working methods to integrate people into the entire development process as users and co-creators to explore, examine, experiment, test and evaluate new ideas, scenarios, processes, systems, concepts and creative solutions in complex and everyday contexts.</div>

### Key components:

There are 4 key components of a Living Lab.

### Steps of LivingLabs

There are 2 phases with 6 steps respectively for a Living Lab, starting with a pre phase and following by a development phase

### Case Studies

* Nijmegen in the Netherlands
* Gothenburg in Sweden
* Olof Asklunds gata

Redevelopment of an industrial area in Södra Änggården into a residential area with apartment buildings, a park, a square, a school, etc. Traffic Waste and Wastewater office of Gothenburg will be involved in a project that concerns all streets and public land, including other infrastructure such as water and wastewater, electricity, energy, etc.

October 20-21 - \[Physical CREATE project meeting in Gothenburg]({{< relref "/post/CREATE-meeting-gbg" >}})

## Project results/ Deliverables

### Overarching Goals

1. Develop and visualize an overview of material stocks and flows that are part of the built environment, 
2. Provide tailored software solutions to cities that support a circular built environment, and 
3. Co-create governance arrangements that enable a broader participation of stakeholders, experimentation with 
   decision-support information, and the upscaling of best practices.
