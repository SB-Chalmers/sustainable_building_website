The DecarbonAIte  project aims to extract data on building characteristics from public databases. 
Use this information to elaborate and reinforce urban digital twin models. 
Finally, through this platform, to propose optimal renovation measures. 
The system to be implemented targets various stakeholders, from building owners to policy makers. 
To achieve the objectives of the project, it is proposed: 

* First, to automate the extraction of the necessary information from public databases for the assessment of building energy performance, environmental impact and life cycle costs.
* Secondly, to feed the city's digital twins with the collected data.
* Third, develop a method to link the data from the digital twins with the building assessment tools in an automated way. 
* Finally, to enable them to propose optimal renovation measures, based on cost and environmental impact over the whole life cycle of the building. 
  
The end product is a user-friendly platform where stakeholders can analyse different options and take informed action.
