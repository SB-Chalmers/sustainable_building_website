title: DecarbonAIte
subtitle: 
summary: The DecarbonAIte  project aims to extract data on building characteristics from public databases. Use this information to elaborate and reinforce urban digital twin models. Finally, through this platform, to propose optimal renovation measures. The system to be implemented targets various stakeholders, from building owners to policy makers.

## Project Overview

DecarbonAIte is a three-year project funded by VINNOVA. The project is focused on developing digital tools and methods for the large-scale energy renovation of buildings. Large-scale renovations are essential to meet the climate goals for 2045. The development of digital city twins offers a foundation for effective renovation planning and provides robust decision support to ensure that the right priorities and optimal measures are implemented.

## Project Areas

The project leverages machine learning (ML) and AI to deliver on several key areas:

- **Digital Twin Creation:**  
  - Retrieve geometric data from public databases to build a digital twin of the building.  
  - Enrich the digital twin with performance simulation data, including enhanced 3D geometry (e.g., window and facade design, building materials).  
  - Employ techniques ranging from ML-based image recognition to gathering actual building data.

- **Technical Data Collection:**  
  - Acquire detailed information on energy usage and technical specifications, such as U-values for windows, from property companies involved as case study sites.

- **Optimization Methods:**  
  - Develop optimization techniques based on genetic algorithms for energy simulation, life cycle analysis (LCA), and life cycle cost analysis (LCC).  
  - Enable the calculation of optimized renovation measures.

- **Decision Support Tool:**  
  - Implement the optimization methods into a decision support tool designed for stakeholders—from large property owners to municipalities.  
  - Validate and refine the tool through testing with the project's three case studies.

## Impact & Future Outlook

Through DecarbonAIte, facility managers and municipalities will gain an advanced digital platform for building management. In the long term, the project aims to:
- Accelerate the pace of building renovations.
- Achieve climate goals by 2045.
- Extend the benefits of enriched digital twins beyond renovation planning to include areas such as municipal energy production planning.
