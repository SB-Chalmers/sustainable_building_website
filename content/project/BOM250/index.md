The master course aims to provide in-depth knowledge on the concepts of Life Cycle Engineering and sustainable design in the built environment. The focus is on buildings and road as well as water infrastructures in different climate zones, regulative frameworks and social-economic circumstances. The overall purpose of the course is to acquaint students with state-of-the-art knowledge for their future professional role as civil engineers, road engineers, planer, consultants, contractors and similar.
  
The main goal of this course is to deepen and broaden already existing skills in applying simultaneously theories, methodologies and tools related to Life Cycle Engineering and Sustainable building and infrastructure design. Instruction and practice in oral and written form with potential contractors and clients will help the students to understand work assignments and the challenges of applying the principles of a sustainable development in their future professional practice. The students will work on case studies/examples, e.g. a building, wall, bridge, road etc. they are dealing or have dealt with in other courses. On these case studies the principles of a Life Cycle Engineering and Sustainable Design will be applied. The course outcomes are a written concepts/plans on when and how to integrate sustainability considerations in the various project phases and a sketch on building/infrastructure design, where these principles have been applied.
