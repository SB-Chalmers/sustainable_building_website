abstract: 'This paper presents a micro-level study of an organisation considering
  to standardise a facility management process. Standards serve an instrumental purpose
  in the built environment reducing complexity by promoting similarity across time
  and space. However, differences in practices and perceptions of involved actors
  can make standardisation a complex endeavour itself, limiting its effectiveness
  as a mode of governance. Science and technology studies (STS) approaches are used
  to study standards in the inspection process. Standardisation is understood in this
  study as performative and a process of power, understanding, and emerging interests.
  The empirical material stems from a case study of a pier facility management process
  at the port of Gothenburg. Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted with actors
  involved in the inspection process – asset managers, structural engineers, inspectors
  and a document controller. Additional observations made during pier inspections
  and project meetings at the port were used to develop the context of the study.
  The analysis shows the multiple demands and interpretations present among involved
  actors prior to an attempt to standardise the pier inspection process. Asset managers
  and structural engineers voice a preference for guidelines that support ideal ways
  of working implemented using a checklist. Alternatively, inspectors wish to receive
  a common terminology. More strategically, the symbolic value of an ISO type standard
  matches a perceived need by the port management for credibility to satisfy customer
  demands. Simultaneously, a standard is expected to give clear directives to hired
  consultants, make the process more cost efficient and ensure a stable quality. The
  variety of interpretations and demands observed in this study underlines the social
  character of asset and facility management and the uses of standards. It is suggested
  to reflect on socio-technical conditions in standard design.  '
