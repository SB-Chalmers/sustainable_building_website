abstract: The global shift towards embodied carbon reduction in the building sector
  has indicated the need for a detailed analysis of environmental impacts across the
  whole lifecycle of buildings. The environmental impact of heating, ventilation,
  and air conditioning (HVAC) systems has rarely been studied in detail. Most of the
  published studies are based on assumptions and rule of thumb techniques. In this
  study, the requirements and methods to perform a detailed life cycle assessment
  (LCA) for HVAC systems based on building information modelling (BIM) are assessed
  and framed for the first time. The approach of linking external product data information
  to objects using visual programming language (VPL) is tested, and its benefits over
  the existing workflows are presented. The detailed BIM model of a newly built office
  building in Switzerland is used as a case study. In addition, detailed project documentation
  is used to ensure the plausibility of the calculated impact. The LCA results show
  that the embodied impact of the HVAC systems is three times higher than the targets
  provided by the Swiss Energy Efficiency Path (SIA 2040). Furthermore, it is shown
  that the embodied impact of HVAC systems lies in the range of 15-36% of the total
  embodied impact of office buildings. Nevertheless, further research and similar
  case studies are needed to provide a robust picture of the embodied environmental
  impact of HVAC systems. The results could contribute to setting stricter targets
  in line with the vision of decarbonization of the building sector.
