abstract: 'Many studies have investigated different aspects in the decarbonisation
  of the European housing stock. However, a comprehensive quantitative analysis of
  the literature on the diffusion of energy efficiency technologies is still missing.
  We conducted a bibliometric analysis to better understand the knowledge base in
  the field energy efficiency technology diffusion in the European residential building
  stock. After the scanning and screening process, we identified 954 scientific articles
  pertinent to this topic. Through a co-citation network analysis, we generated a
  visual knowledge structure of the field and by the further investigation of the
  bibliography we were able to synthesize the state-of-the-art and answer to our initial
  research questions. Results of the co-citation network show a scattered and fragmented
  field in many domains. The descriptive analysis highlights this fragmentation, especially
  on a cross-country level among EU country members. Findings from this study contribute
  to map the scientific knowledge base in relation to technology diffusion in European
  residential building projects, identify relevant topic areas, visualize the links
  between the topics, as well as to recognize research gaps and opportunities. The
  methodology utilized in this paper proved to be viable approach to map and characterize
  the knowledge base within a field and can, therefore, be replicated in upcoming
  studies with analogous ambitions.  '
