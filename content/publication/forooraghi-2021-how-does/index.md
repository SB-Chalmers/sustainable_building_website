abstract: 'This study investigated the current design circumstances of an office as
  well as employees’ perceptions of the office environment in relation to their perceived
  health, drawing on sense of coherence theory (comprehensibility, manageability,
  and meaningfulness). Previous studies have related the physical office environment
  to employee health. However, most studies have focused on alleviating negative effects,
  while health-promoting potential, including employee sense of coherence, has been
  overlooked. This study adopted a mixed method case study approach, combining semi-structured
  interviews with employees, structured observations, and analysis of architectural
  drawings. The results indicated that employees’ perceptions did not always align
  with the ideas behind the architectural design and that employees understood the
  environment differently. The study also highlighted the interrelations (and contradictions)
  among the different components of sense of coherence. The findings imply that organizations
  may need to prioritize which components of coherence should be supported most by
  the office environment. It also suggests that case-specific design aspects should
  play a more central role in studying and conceptualizing healthy office design and
  that design solutions should be continuously modified during the use phase, while
  ensuring employees’ participation. The study concluded that an ‘ideal’ office environment
  should not be the goal. Instead, office design should provide an environment in
  which employees are able to cope with challenges in comprehensible, manageable and
  meaningful ways.  '
