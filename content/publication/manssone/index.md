abstract: 'An upcoming demand for higher energy efficiency in the society requires
  multiple actions to reduce the amount of unutilised energy. Supermarkets are part
  of the sixth largest energy consumers in Germany, the food industries, and hold
  a great potential for increase of its energy efficiency and at the same time contribute
  to buffering capacity needed in grids that have a large share of renewables.A state
  of the art supermarket designed according to the demands of Passive House Institute
  has been built by REWE in Hannover Germany. Measurements are proving it to have
  energy consumption substantially lower than an average supermarket of the same size.
  Monitoring also proves a substantial amount of buffering capacity in the cooling
  processes.Extrapolation shows a substantial potential for buffering grid fluctuations
  due to delaying cooling processes in Germany especially when complementing the system
  with ice storage  '
