abstract: '© 2017 Elsevier B.V. Material intensity coefficient (MIC) databases are
  crucial for bottom-up material stock studies. However, MIC databases are site specific
  and not available in many countries. For this reason, a MIC database of residential
  buildings in Sweden was created in this study. As these had not previously been
  explored, considerable attention was paid to MIC database results, variables and
  limitations. Next, to contextualize the results, the database was compared and discussed
  with other studies in other geographical scales and regions. The MIC database is
  based on (1) specialized architectural-data and (2) densities of construction materials.
  The study looked at 46 typical residential buildings in Sweden, 12 single-family
  (SF) and 34 multi-family (MF) structures, built within the time period 1880ö2010.
  The results show specific trends for material intensity and composition, but also
  for the mass distribution of different building elements. Additionally, it was shown
  that the number of floors and the footprint size of a building have a considerable
  impact on the MICs, especially for buildings with a low number of floors, such as
  SF structures. Furthermore, when compared to MIC databases from other countries,
  the study database, which relates to Sweden, shows a higher intensity for wood and
  steel. Finally, contradictory MIC results for similar geographical regions were
  highlighted and discussed. This showed that to achieve consistent standardized MIC
  databases, further analysis of MIC databases for different geographical scales and
  regions are needed, and this is therefore recommended.  '
