abstract: Life cycle assessment (LCA) has not been widely applied in the building
  design process because it is perceived to be complex and time-consuming. There is
  a high demand for simplified approaches that architects can use without detailed
  knowledge of LCA. This paper presents a parametric LCA approach, which allows architects
  to efficiently reduce the environmental impact of building designs.
