 abstract = {NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the DNAs from biopsy specimens of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC, EBV DNA positive) using calcium phosphate precipitation method. The malignant, transformed foci of NIH 3T3 cells have been observed and cloned. The hybridization of transfectant DNA digested by EcoRI with total human leukocyte DNA as probe was performed. The strong signal of smear comparing with NIH 3T3 DNA as control was observed. It was implied that the putative human transforming sequences had been integrated into transformed cells. Employing soft agar culture, the transformed cells can grow and form cell colonies. Following transfer, the foci were able to grow and adhere to a glass wall. These cells were easily agglutinated by con A. The cloned foci have been inoculated into nude mice with the formation of highly malignant sarcomas. In preliminary experiments for characterizing the transforming sequences, Ha‐ras and Blym 1 were found in transfectants derived from one of the NPC DNA samples. It is implicated that these two oncogenes might be responsible for the acquisition of malignant phenotypic character of some human NPC. The further identification of oncogenes in NPC is currently in progress. Copyright © 1986 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},
