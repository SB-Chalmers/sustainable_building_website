abstract: Based on the optimized design of the lattice for therapy synchrotron and
  considering the requirement of radiation therapy, the third order resonant extraction
  is adopted. Using the momentum-amplitude selection method, the extraction system
  is designed and optimized. An extraction efficiency of more than 97% and a momentum
  spread less than 0.11% are obtained. Â© 2009 Chinese Physical Society and the Institute
