abstract: 'In light of recent research, it is evident that occupants are playing an
  increasingly important role in building energy performance. Despite the important
  role of building energy codes and standards in design, the occupant-related aspects
  are typically simple and have not kept up with the leading research. This paper
  reviews 23 regionsâ€™ building energy codes and standards by first comparing their
  quantitative aspects and then analyzing their mandated rules and approaches. While
  the present paper focuses on offices, general recommendations are applicable to
  other building types as well. The review revealed a wide range of occupant-related
  values, approaches, and attitudes. For example, code-specified occupant density
  varies by nearly a factor of three between different codes. This underlines the
  need for development of advancement in occupant behavior modeling approaches for
  future occupant-centric building performance codes and standards. Moreover, occupants
  are often referred to only implicitly; underlying expectations about energy-saving
  occupant behavior from building occupants varies greatly; and, only a few codes
  address occupant feedback and system usability. Based on the findings of the review,
  a set of initial recommendations for future building energy codes is proposed.  '
