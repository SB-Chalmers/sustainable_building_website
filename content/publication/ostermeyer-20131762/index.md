abstract: 'Purpose: This paper addresses the application and potential of LCSA in
  the built environment with a focus on refurbishments of residential buildings. It
  specifically addresses the phenomenon of interchange of building technologies efficiencies
  under different life time assessments from economy, ecology and social fields. An
  approach of optimization rather than hard target numbers is proposed as win-win-win
  situations are unlikely. Methods: A multidimensional Pareto optimization methodology,
  using LCC, LCA combined with first stages of a social assessment in a feasibility
  study but potentially later full SLCA, is proposed, which site-specifically visualizes
  the interchange between different options in building design or modification, and
  evaluates optimal overall concepts. LCA and LCC are used to analyze a case study
  from an EU project named BEEM-UP in which solutions for large-scale uptake of refurbishment
  strategies are developed. Social frame conditions are taken into account by identifying
  the driving technologies and feeding the consequences of their implementation for
  the residents into the tenant involvement part of the project. Results and discussion:
  The calculations prove that the general assumptions leading to the methodology hold
  true at least for this case study. A clear Pareto-optimal curve is visible when
  assessing LCC and LCA. The example buildings results show certain systems to be
  dominating clusters on the figures while others clearly can be identified as not
  relevant. Several of the driving technologies however fail to be applicable because
  of social frame conditions, e.g., clear requests by the tenants. Based on the conclusions,
  the potential for including SLCA as a third dimension in the methodology and possible
  visualization options are discussed. Conclusions: The development in the field of
  social indicators in the building sector has to be strengthened in order to come
  up with a holistic picture and respectively with appropriate responses to current
  challenges. While some solutions identified in the LCC/LCA assessment also have
  good social characteristics, several others have not and solutions identified as
  lacking might have social advantages that are currently left out of consideration
  The upcoming Standards EN 15643-5 and ISO 15686-x are a promising step in this direction
  as is the work to create a conceptual framework for impact assessment within SLCA
  by the scientific community. Â© 2013 The Author(s).'
