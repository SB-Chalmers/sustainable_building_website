abstract: 'The existing building stock provide a possibility for cost-efficient energy
  efficiency measures and related reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions. As the rate
  of renewal in the buildingstock is low, energy efficiency measures need to be applied
  when renovation is being done in order to reach climate goals. To increase the renovation
  rate and realise the potential for substantial reductions in energy use, several
  research and demonstration projects have been carried out on both a European and
  Swedish level. In order to evaluate the current state and renovation potential of
  the existing building stock on an urban level, a local approach is needed to understand
  challenges and possibilities associated with the transformation of the building-stock.
  To quantify the potential for reducing energy use and greenhouse-gas emissions,
  building-stock modelling is commonly used. However, these models are often based
  on using representative buildings and scaling factors. With increased spatial resolution,
  building descriptions based on representative buildings lose accuracy and as a result,
  stakeholders operating at a planning or policy level are commonly targeted. This
  study proposes a building-specific stock description where each building is treated
  individually to differentiate the renovation potential within the building-stock.
  For this purpose, available databases containing building-specific information has
  been gathered and processed for the multi-family building stock of the City of Gothenburg.
  The available data is used to create a building-specific stock description and renovation
  measures are modelled using a bottom-up engineering method and evaluated regarding
  energy use, environmental impact and costeffectiveness. This thesis with appended
  papers shows that available data sources can be used to describe the characteristics
  of the stock on a building level and model the effect of renovation on energy use,
  environmental impact and cost-effectiveness in order to provide detailed information
  to policy makers, planners and property owners.  '
