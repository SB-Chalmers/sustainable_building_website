 abstract = {The concept of sustainable buildings includes not only technological aspects related to energy efficiency and resources usage optimization, but also aspects related to end-users' comfort, wellbeing, and everyday needs support. To understand the end-users' life activities in general and their preferences in particular, is necessary to enrich standard Building Management Systems (BMS) with human-generated and personal data. In this conceptual paper, we present an end-user context information management framework, which includes a reasoning layer, an acquisition layer, and a dissemination layer. The proposed framework is currently implemented in the KTH Live-in-Lab - a fully equipped testbed for research and innovation in the build environment.  },
