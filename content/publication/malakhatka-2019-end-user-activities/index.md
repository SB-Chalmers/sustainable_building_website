abstract: "The concept of sustainable buildings includes not only technological aspects\
  \ related to energy efficiency and resources usage optimization, but also aspects\
  \ related to end-users' comfort, wellbeing, and everyday needs support. To understand\
  \ the end-users' life activities in general and their preferences in particular,\
  \ is necessary to enrich standard Building Management Systems (BMS) with human-generated\
  \ and personal data. In this conceptual paper, we present an end-user context information\
  \ management framework, which includes a reasoning layer, an acquisition layer,\
  \ and a dissemination layer. The proposed framework is currently implemented in\
  \ the KTH Live-in-Lab - a fully equipped testbed for research and innovation in\
  \ the build environment.  "
