abstract: 'To study thermal comfort under task/ambient conditioning (TAC) system,
  equivalent temperature (EQT) index was used to evaluate local and overall thermal
  sensation under non-uniform thermal environment. From the “human subject test in
  a mockup office”, local thermal sensations and equivalent temperatures under different
  stimulated conditions were collected. It is found that thermal sensation and equivalent
  temperature have a good linear relationship. EQT comfort zone of the TAC in non-uniform
  environment was drawn through the fitting method. The findings are of significance
  on the design and operation of TAC system.  '
