abstract: 'Buildings are responsible for a large share of CO2 emissions in the world.
  Building renovation is crucial to decrease the environmental impact and meet the
  United Nations climate action goals. However, due to buildings’ long service lives,
  there are many uncertainties that might cause a deviation in the results of a predicted
  retrofit outcome. In this paper, we determine climate-friendly and cost-effective
  renovation scenarios for two typical buildings with low and high energy performance
  in Switzerland using a methodology of robust optmization. First, we create an integrated
  model for life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost analysis (LCCA). Second,
  we define possible renovation measures and possible levels of renovation. Third,
  we identify and describe the uncertain parameters related to the production, replacement
  and dismantling of building elements as well as the operational energy use in LCCA
  and LCA. Afterwards, we carry out a robust multi-objective optimization to identify
  optimal renovation solutions. The results show that the replacement of the heating
  system in the building retrofit process is crucial to decrease the environmental
  impact. They also show that for a building with already good energy performance,
  the investments are not paid off by the operational savings. The optimal solution
  for the building with low energy performance includes the building envelope renovation
  in combination with the heating system replacement. For both buildings, the optimal
  robust cost-effective and climate-friendly solution is different from the deep renovation
  practice promoted to decrease the energy consumption of a building.  '
