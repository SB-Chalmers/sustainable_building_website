abstract: 'The present work demonstrates the performance evaluation and economic analysis
  of different PV module types and brands at the working conditions of Padiham (53.5
  N, 2.3 W) in the UK. The total area of PV plant was assumed to be 100 square meters.
  The simulations were carried out for modules installed on the roof and on the south-facing
  façade of a residential building. The comparison study is carried out to define
  the most suitable module type and brands for the considered place in the current
  study. The energy and economic performance of the grid-connected PV system are analyzed
  under the meteorological conditions of Padiham. The modules were characterized by
  evaluating their annual electrical energy generation and different figures of merit
  of the grid-connected PV systems such as the investment, annual profit, net present
  value, levelized cost of electricity, and the payback time. The simulations show
  that in this specific setup, monocrystalline modules have the best energy performance,
  while thin-film modules have the best economic performance.  '
