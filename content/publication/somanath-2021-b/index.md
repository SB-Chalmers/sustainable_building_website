abstract: Digital tools for performance-assessment are commonly used to shorten the
  feedback loop in testing designs for buildings and neighbourhoods. However, these
  tools do not extend to the social dimension in the same way as the economic and
  environmental dimensions. This paper aims to contribute to the development of digital
  tools to design socially sustainable neighbourhoods. We analyse 115 academic articles
  to establish a theoretical understanding of Social Sustainability (SoSu). Based
  on these results, we propose a digital user-interaction model to operationalise
  SoSu in the digital design process of buildings. In the literature, we observe a
  lack of consensus on the theoretical discussion on SoSu. Several extrinsic and intrinsic
  factors are identified contributing to this fuzziness; the dependency on stakeholder
  value systems, the qualitative nature of social indicators, and comparison to environmental
  sustainability being the most common. Still, we distinguish two overarching categories,
  social equity and social capital, that are further divided into sub-themes. Having
  mapped the categories and hierarchies of social themes, we propose a user-interaction
  model that incorporates these findings into a digital environment. The user-interaction
  model creates a guided decision-making framework for architects and urban planners
  by enabling stakeholders to make conscious and informed decisions grounded in theory.
