 abstract = {Proactive maintenance strategies in principle are devised to control degradation and sustain optimal performance of building components. While realizing the technical necessities, they also serve as an instrument towards multiple and often conflicting objectives during financial con- straints. An optimal proactive maintenance strategy therefore should comprise a multiannual maintenance action plan optimized on different criteria corresponding to owners' objectives under existing constraints. This study offers a systematic approach based on a condition-deteri- oration model to address the complexity involved in decision making regarding optimized main- tenance and renovation planning. Life-cycle cost analysis in form of Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) is used for the economic assessment of maintenance/renovation scenarios. In this paper, the model is used to compare the economy of different maintenance/renovation plans in a chosen scenario in order to determine the optimal maintenance interval for a single and a com- bination of building components. Two fac ̧ade elements, windows and fac ̧ade rendering, are used to illustrate the application of the proposed method. This method is intended to help deci- sion makers at both design and post-construction phases in the choice of both building compo- nents and maintenance/renovation strategies.  },
