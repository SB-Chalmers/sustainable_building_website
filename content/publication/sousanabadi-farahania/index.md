abstract: "Proactive maintenance strategies in principle are devised to control degradation\
  \ and sustain optimal performance of building components. While realizing the technical\
  \ necessities, they also serve as an instrument towards multiple and often conflicting\
  \ objectives during financial con- straints. An optimal proactive maintenance strategy\
  \ therefore should comprise a multiannual maintenance action plan optimized on different\
  \ criteria corresponding to owners' objectives under existing constraints. This\
  \ study offers a systematic approach based on a condition-deteri- oration model\
  \ to address the complexity involved in decision making regarding optimized main-\
  \ tenance and renovation planning. Life-cycle cost analysis in form of Equivalent\
  \ Annual Cost (EAC) is used for the economic assessment of maintenance/renovation\
  \ scenarios. In this paper, the model is used to compare the economy of different\
  \ maintenance/renovation plans in a chosen scenario in order to determine the optimal\
  \ maintenance interval for a single and a com- bination of building components.\
  \ Two fac ̧ade elements, windows and fac ̧ade rendering, are used to illustrate\
  \ the application of the proposed method. This method is intended to help deci-\
  \ sion makers at both design and post-construction phases in the choice of both\
  \ building compo- nents and maintenance/renovation strategies.  "
