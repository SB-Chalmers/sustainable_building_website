abstract: 'The construction sector has a significant share of Green House Gas emission
  and raw material consumption globally. Among common construction materials, timber
  has a long tradition of numerous applications as a renewable material. The implementation
  of the concept of circularity in the process of the construction of timber buildings
  has a high potential sustainability impact. The concept of design for adaption is
  to extend the service life of timber building to the maximum in several life cycles.
  In this paper the demand regarding circularity is analysed from interviews with
  different stakeholders and their economic, social and environmental incentive. The
  possibility to assess the sustainability impact of design for adaption are evaluated.
  Different examples of existing practices and potential solutions for design for
  deconstruction and adaption are summarized.  '
