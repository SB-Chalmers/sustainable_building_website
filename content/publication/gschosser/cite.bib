 abstract = {The subject of this paper is an environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) of processes needed to construct and maintain representative Swiss asphalt, concrete and composite pavements (including subbase layers) applicable for the Swiss national road network over a period of 75 years. The environmental indicators analyzed are the Global Warming Potential indicator, the non-renewable Cumulative Energy Demand and the Swiss Ecological Scarcity indicator. Processes of the use phase of the road (fuel consumption, noise, etc.) have been evaluated qualitatively based on intensive research. The study shows that the Global Warming Potential of concrete and asphalt pavements equilibrates over the analysis period and that concrete pavements compared to asphalt and composite pavements offer advantages in regards to the non-renewable Cumulative Energy Demand, the Ecological Scarcity Indicator and Life Cycle Costs. The qualitative evaluation of the processes of the use phase shows for example the positive qualities of concrete pavements regarding fuel consumption and permanent noise properties.  },
