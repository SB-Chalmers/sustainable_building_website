abstract: 'The subject of this paper is an environmental Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
  and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) of processes needed to construct and maintain
  representative Swiss asphalt, concrete and composite pavements (including subbase
  layers) applicable for the Swiss national road network over a period of 75 years.
  The environmental indicators analyzed are the Global Warming Potential indicator,
  the non-renewable Cumulative Energy Demand and the Swiss Ecological Scarcity indicator.
  Processes of the use phase of the road (fuel consumption, noise, etc.) have been
  evaluated qualitatively based on intensive research. The study shows that the Global
  Warming Potential of concrete and asphalt pavements equilibrates over the analysis
  period and that concrete pavements compared to asphalt and composite pavements offer
  advantages in regards to the non-renewable Cumulative Energy Demand, the Ecological
  Scarcity Indicator and Life Cycle Costs. The qualitative evaluation of the processes
  of the use phase shows for example the positive qualities of concrete pavements
  regarding fuel consumption and permanent noise properties.  '
