abstract: 'Resource productivity and evidence of economic decoupling were investigated
  on the basis of the time series in 1996-2011 of material flow analysis for Sweden,
  Stockholm, and Gothenburg. In the three cases, absolute reductions in CO2 emissions
  by about 20% were observed, energy consumption per capita decreased, while gross
  domestic product (GDP) per capita grew. The energy consumption of the residential
  and public sectors decreased drastically, while the transport energy consumption
  is still growing steadily. Decoupling of the economy as a whole (i.e., including
  materials) is not yet happening at any scale. The domestic material consumption
  (DMC) continues to increase, in parallel with the GDP. The rate of increase for
  DMC is slower than that for GDP in both Stockholm and Sweden as a whole (i.e., relative
  decoupling). The metabolism of the cities does not replicate the national metabolism,
  and the two cities each have their own distinct metabolism profiles. As a consequence,
  policy implications for each of the case studies were suggested. In general, because
  of the necessarily different roles of the two cities in the national economy, generic
  resource productivity benchmarks, such as CO2 per capita, should be avoided in favor
  of sectorial benchmarks, such as industry, transport, or residential CO2 per capita.
  In addition, the share of the city impacts caused by the provision of a service
  for the rest of the country, such as a port, could be allocated to the national
  economy.  '
