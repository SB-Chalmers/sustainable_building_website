abstract: 'Decision makers are tasked with defining and implementing measures that
  can meet established environmental targets. However, it is not always clear how
  effective the measure(s) will be in meeting the specified goals and which measures
  should be prioritized for implementation. To fill this gap, we have developed a
  method for testing planned actions to estimate potential impact on targets. The
  method can be performed at any scale, e.g., at the national, regional, or city level.
  The approach considers several factors, including the total consumption of an area,
  region-specific consumption-based environmental hotspots, the decision makers, the
  reduction targets and related measures, as well as multiple impact types. We present
  the method using the example of the municipality Gothenburg, Sweden. In collaboration
  with local authorities in Gothenburg, we co-created scenarios that bundle proposed
  measures intended to make progress towards their climate target of 3.5 tons carbon
  dioxide equivalents per capita. We then quantified how measures related to two known
  environmental hotspots, fuel and electronics, may affect climate change impact levels
  by the target year of 2035. The scenarios indicate that despite targeting known
  high-impact product types in Gothenburg, the efforts lead to only 14% of the reduction
  needed to meet the specified goal.  '
