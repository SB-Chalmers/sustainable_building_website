abstract: The importance of evaluation and improvement of life cycle performance of
  buildings in early design stages is widely acknowledged, the wide application of
  Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) however, is restrained by big uncertainty in design
  and material decisions at this stage. The approach presented in this paper aims
  to provide a proof-of-concept for an integrated assessment of the environmental
  impact of building construction using Building Information Modeling (BIM). To support
  decision-making in the critical early design stages, we propose a workflow of using
  conceptual BIM models and visual scripting to test a wide variety of possible construction
  options. The overall effects on the building's total impact are calculated for the
  various options to identify design specific hotspots. Different aspects of the results
  can be visualized to support intuitive design guidance.
