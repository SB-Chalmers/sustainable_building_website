abstract: 'The method Schroeder is accepted amongst real estate professionals in Switzerland
  as a near standard for condition monitoring, budgeting of maintenance and refurbishment,
  and strategic decision support in point of building portfolios. It is based on the
  devaluation curves of 12 or more building elements. Main results are the actual
  and the prognosticated future building condition in percentage of its reinstatement
  value, the residual useful service life of building elements, and the calculationof
  future maintenance and refurbishment costs. 25 years after its first publication,
  this paper analyses the assumptions made, compares the method to other methods in
  this field, and validates the method in several steps, based on scientific or empirical
  evidence. Furthermore, a desktop simulation of a well-documented portfolio was performed
  and compared, the answers from a questionnaire amongst users are provided, and the
  partially controversial conclusions are discussed.  '
