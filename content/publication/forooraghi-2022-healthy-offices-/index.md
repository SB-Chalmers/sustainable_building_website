abstract: "This thesis explores the interrelations between the design characteristics\
  \ of activity-based offices, users’ perceptions of them, and users’ sense of coherence.\
  \ The goal is twofold: (i) contribute to conceptualizations of healthy activity-based\
  \ offices and (ii) facilitate practical use of the sense of coherence theory for\
  \ office designers. Most research into healthy offices has focused on harm-causing\
  \ factors (pathogenic aspects) while overlooking the health-promoting design characteristics\
  \ in activity-based offices (salutogenic aspects). This thesis is a response to\
  \ the call for a paradigm shift and explores the particular design characteristics\
  \ of activity-based offices that promote health, drawing on the salutogenic approach\
  \ and sense of coherence theory. The thesis builds on a literature review and two\
  \ mixed methods case studies on activity-based offices. Drawing on the sense of\
  \ coherence framework, three types of design characteristics were identified: (i)\
  \ those that promote a clear understanding of office environments, (ii) those that\
  \ enhance users' access to relevant resources, and (iii) those that evoke meaning\
  \ for users to cope with stressors. These characteristics and the perceptions of\
  \ them are interrelated meaning that they can have multiple impacts on users’ sense\
  \ of coherence. The findings also highlighted temporal changes in users’ perceptions,\
  \ indicating that novelties of the new office wore off and the initial problems\
  \ observed in the office environment worsened. Moreover, activity-based offices\
  \ were not always perceived as intended because of suboptimal design solutions and\
  \ contextual factors. In conclusion, there are no definitive answers to how to design\
  \ healthy activity-based offices. Activity-based offices are complex environments\
  \ and consist of many interacting aspects including the design characteristics,\
  \ individuals’, and their work-related prerequisite as well as organization-related\
  \ factors that influence users’ perceptions and their sense of coherence. The framework\
  \ developed in this thesis may contribute to better-informed discussions about designing\
  \ for sense of coherence. The thesis suggests that healthy activity-based offices\
  \ should be viewed as a \\\"moving project\\\" that develops over time through experimentation\
  \ and adaptation, with management’s involvement. Thus, a healthy activity-based\
  \ office provides users resources and opportunities to codesign an environment that\
  \ enables them (i) build meaningful social relationships, (ii) manage visual and\
  \ acoustic distractions, (iii) read and understand workspaces, and (iv) receive\
  \ support from management in their daily work.  "
