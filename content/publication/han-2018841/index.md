abstract: The genus Canarium contains approximately 78 species distributed in the
  Old World tropics and subtropics. Canarium is characterized by a distinctive drupaceous
  fruit with a trilocular endocarp derived from three fused pyrenes. Here, we describe
  new Canarium fossil fruits from the late Oligocene of the Yongning Formation, the
  Miocene of the Erzitang Formation, and the late Miocene of the Foluo Formation in
  Guangxi Province, South China, providing the first confirmed fossil occurrences
  of Canarium in eastern Asia. The fruits of Canarium guangxiensis Han & Manchester
  sp. nov. are ovoidal to spindle shaped, 22.8–34.3 mm long, and 10.7–14.6 mm wide.
  Computed tomography (CT) scan was used to study the morphological and anatomical
  characters of fossil and modern Canarium, facilitating identification of the fossil
  fruits. This new occurrence supplements other megafossil records of Canarium fruits
  from the Eocene in North America, the Eocene to Oligocene in Europe, the Oligocene
  in Africa, the Oligocene to Miocene in Asia and from the Pleistocene in Australia
  and the Pacific islands. The fossil record indicates a wide dispersal of Canarium
  over the Northern Hemisphere during the Eocene and Oligocene, followed by a geographical
  contraction during the Miocene as the result of its extinction from North America
  and Europe. The origin and migratory routes of this genus are not clearly resolved,
  but based on the fossils known so far, we hypothesize that Canarium may have had
  a North American Eocene origin, with subsequent spread to Eurasia and Africa, followed
  by dispersal to the Southern Hemisphere. © 2017, © The Trustees of the Natural History
