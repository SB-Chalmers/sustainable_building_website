abstract: 'Geogrids made of geosynthetics can replace conventional building materials
  like concrete. In this article, goal andscope, basic data and the results of a comparative
  life cycle assessment of concrete reinforced retaining walls (CRRW) and geosynthetics
  reinforced retaining walls (GRRW) are described. One running meter of a three meters
  high retaining wall forms the basis for comparison. The two walls have the same
  technical performance and an equal life time of 100 years. The GRRW has a lower
  demand of steel and concrete compared to the CRRW. The product system includes the
  supply of the raw materials, the manufacture of the geotextiles and the concrete,
  the construction of the wall, its use and its end of life. The life cycle assessment
  reveals that the GRRW causes lower environmental impacts. The cumulative greenhouse
  gas emissions of 300 m CRRW are 400 t and 70 t in case of GRRW. The use of an environmentally
  friendlier lorry in a sensitivity analysis and monte carlo simulation confirm the
  lower environmental impacts caused by the construction of a GRRW compared to a CRRW.
  More than 70 % of the environmental impacts of the geogrids production are caused
  by the raw material provision (plastic granulate) and the electricity demand in
  manufacturing.  '
