abstract: 'Different users and investors´ project preferences, often lead to trade-offs
  during the early design phase of a project. Currently, decisions of design options
  and their technical measures are mainly reduced to an instantaneously assessed criterion
  (i.e. energy efficiency) within the sustainability assessment of buildings. Due
  to criteria interdependency, the current linear applied approach used in building
  certification neglects criteria trade-offs and is therefore only partly suitable
  for holistic building improvement processes. In order to fulfil stakeholder interests
  on the one hand and a high sustainability performance on the other, it is crucial
  to identify appropriate design measures. Based on the Austrian building certification
  system ÖGNI/DGNB, we applied a systemic approach for building sustainability-improvement,
  using a case study of a public office building in Graz, Austria. The main part of
  the study describes the important steps required for the systemic optimization of
  building sustainability. The method applied in this study allows the quantification
  of the relative influence and the identification of the individual optimization
  potential of design options on each single assessment criterion. The proposed systemic
  approach clearly demonstrated the improvement potential of the currently most developed
  building certification system considering the interdependency between the individual
  criteria.  '
