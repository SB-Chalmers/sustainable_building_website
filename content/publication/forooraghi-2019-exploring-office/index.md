abstract: 'Aim: This article explores emerging design approaches in relation to health
  in the context of office building design. Background: Design for health is an emergent
  theme in architectural design. Healthcare sector has long dealt with the built environment
  and its health outcomes. In the past decades, there has been growing interest in
  the potential of design approaches with a key focus on patientsâ€™ health such as
  Co-design, Evidence-based design, Salutogenic design, User-centred design. Some
  of these approaches extend beyond healthcare to sectors such as schools and offices.
  Nevertheless, very little is currently known about how these design approaches relate
  to employee health and wellbeing in office building design. Therefore, new insights
  into the existing literature is needed to support discussions on future office design
  among researchers. Methods: A scoping review of 7432 papers was conducted in 2018,
  in four electronic databases and five scientific journals to scan design approaches
  in relation to health and wellbeing in office building design resulting in the selection
  of 26 papers. Result: The review, firstly, disclosed a mismatch between the research
  outputs and target population. Secondly, a limited understanding of health in relation
  to office physical environment was noted. Lastly, design approaches were found to
  be underdeveloped in the field of office design. Conclusion: It was noted that Salutogenic
  orientation toward health is not well-recognized in work environments. Further research
  might be useful to conceptualize positive aspects of health in relation to physical
  office environment. Design for health is becoming more visible in office context,
  however, more research is required to expand our thinking toward the impact of the
  interplay of design aspects on those health and wellbeing related outcomes. This
  might be through firstly identifying the dimensions of office environments that
  can support employee well-being, and, secondly, testing and validating existing
  frameworks. Considering the different cultural norms for dissemination, with research
  agenda focusing on scholarly communication, against a far more visual language used
  by designers, we need to identify ways to increase visibility and readability of
  research outputs  '
