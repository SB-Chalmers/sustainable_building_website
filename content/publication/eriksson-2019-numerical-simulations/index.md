abstract: "Point Daylight Factor (DFP) has been used for daylighting design in Sweden\
  \ for more than 40 years. Progressive densification of urban environments, in combination\
  \ with stricter regulations on energy performance and indoor environmental quality\
  \ of buildings, creates complex daylight design challenges that cannot be adequately\
  \ solved with DFP. To support a development of the current and future daylight indicators\
  \ in the Swedish context, the authors have developed a comprehensive methodology\
  \ for the evaluation of daylight levels in existing buildings. The methodology comprises\
  \ sample buildings of various use and their digital replicas in 3D, detailed numerical\
  \ simulations and correlations of diverse DF metrics in existing buildings, a field\
  \ investigation on residents' satisfaction with available daylight levels in their\
  \ homes, and a comparison between the numerical and experimental data. The study\
  \ was deliberately limited to the evaluation of DF metrics for their intuitive understanding\
  \ and easy evaluation in real design projects. The sample buildings represent typical\
  \ architectural styles and building technologies between 1887 and 2013 in Gothenburg\
  \ and include eight residential buildings, two office buildings, two schools, two\
  \ student apartment buildings, and two hospitals. Although the simulated DFP is\
  \ 1.4% on average, i.e., above the required 1%, large variations have been found\
  \ between the studied 1200 rooms. The empirical data generally support the findings\
  \ from the numerical simulations, but also bring unique insights in the residences'\
  \ preferences for rooms with good daylight. The most remarkable result is related\
  \ to kitchens, typically the spaces with the lowest DF values, based on simulations,\
  \ while the residents wish them to be the spaces with the most daylight. Finally,\
  \ the work introduces a new DF metric, denoted DFW, which allows daylighting design\
  \ in early stages when only limited data on the building shape and windows' arrangement\
  \ are available.  "
