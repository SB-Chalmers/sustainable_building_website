abstract: 'In developed countries, the residential and commercial building stock account
  for a considerable share of final energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Building
  stock modeling is an established tool to assess different development paths of buildings
  on city, region or country level. Current building stock models (BSM) as well as
  previous works of the authors, however, lack a holistic approach that take technological,
  economic and ecological factors into account on an individual building scale. There
  are, therefore, limitations in the conclusions that can be drawn. In order to increase
  their significance, current research shows trends towards spatial differentiation,
  representation of individual building and owners as well as economic decision modeling.
  However, no model combines all three aspects in a more holistic approach. This paper
  describes a novel approach which combines spatial differentiation with building
  specific heat demand modeling and an economic decision simulation. The model developed
  combines a building specific engineering model with a micro-economic discrete choice
  approach. Using spatial building data, the engineering model calculates space heat
  and hot water energy demand on a building level. The alteration of the building
  refurbishment state is modeled using a discrete choice approach to simulate the
  decision process of building owners of building envelope refurbish and/or to substitute
  the heating system. Due to the building specific approach, the decision model is
  able to take into account building specific information such as size, geometry,
  room temperature, investment, maintenance and energy costs and achievable energy
  savings as well as other factors such as local potentials and restrictions on the
  use of renewable energy. In a case study of the city of Zürich we demonstrate the
  feasibility and strengths of the new model approach. The results demonstrate that
  modeling space heating demand on an individual building scale yields specific heat
  demand distribution across building clusters (and not simply in average values as
  in other models). The building level approach enables the model to deliver differentiated
  results of the heat demand development for the whole building stock, building types
  building periods or spatially distributed as shown in the results.  '
