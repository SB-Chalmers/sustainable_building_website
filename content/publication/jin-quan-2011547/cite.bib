 abstract = {In the classroom teaching of Mechanical Innovation, authors introduce small research projects which need students ' active thinking and practical design, in order to guide students in accordance with the design engineers thinking and creative thinking approach to mechanical design work. Such small research projects are open and comprehensive, needing students' innovative design, integrated using of a variety of modern design and engineering software and ways of thinking based on engineering. And in this paper, authors also explored implementation methods and evaluation mechanisms of the small research projects. Practice shows that: the implementation of research projects, not only improved the students' comprehensive design capabilities and trained in engineering design thinking, but also can enhance the innovation ability of students.
