abstract: "In the classroom teaching of Mechanical Innovation, authors introduce small\
  \ research projects which need students ' active thinking and practical design,\
  \ in order to guide students in accordance with the design engineers thinking and\
  \ creative thinking approach to mechanical design work. Such small research projects\
  \ are open and comprehensive, needing students' innovative design, integrated using\
  \ of a variety of modern design and engineering software and ways of thinking based\
  \ on engineering. And in this paper, authors also explored implementation methods\
  \ and evaluation mechanisms of the small research projects. Practice shows that:\
  \ the implementation of research projects, not only improved the students' comprehensive\
  \ design capabilities and trained in engineering design thinking, but also can enhance\
  \ the innovation ability of students. Â© 2012 Springer-Verlag."
