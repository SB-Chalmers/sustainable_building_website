abstract: 'Purpose Growing awareness of the environmental performanceof construction
  products and buildings brings aboutthe need for a suitable method to assess their
  environmentalperformance. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become awidely recognised
  and accepted method to assess the burdensand impacts throughout the life cycle.
  This LCA-based information may be in the form of environmental product declarations
  (EPD) or product environmental footprints (PEF), based on reliable and verifiable
  information. All of these use LCA to quantify and report several environmental impact
  categorie and may also provide additional information. To better understand on the
  one hand existing EPD programmes (EN 15804) for each country and on the other the
  recent developments in terms of EU reference document (e.g. PEF), the authors decided
  to write this review paper based on the outcomes of the EPD workshop that was held
  prior to SB13 Graz conference.Methods This paper presents the state of the art in
  LCA and an overview of the EPD programmes in five European countries(Austria, Belgium,
  France, Germany, Switzerland) based on the workshop in the first part and a comprehensive
  description and comparison of the PEF method and EN 15804 in the second part. In
  the last part, a general conclusion will wrap up the findings and results will provide
  a further outlook on future activities.Results and discussion The high number of
  EPD programmesunderlines the fact that there is obviously a demand for assessments
  of the environmental performance of construction materials.In the comparison between
  and experiences of thedifferent countries, it can be seen that more similarities
  than differences exist. A comparison between PEF and EPD shows differences, e.g.
  LCIA impact categories and recyclingmethodology. Conclusions Independent of raising
  awareness of the construction material environmental performance, the existence
  of somany environmental claims calls for clarification andharmonisation. Additionally,
  construction materials beingassessed in the voluntary approaches have to follow
  theharmonised approach following the principles of the EuropeanConstruction Products
  Regulation (regulated) not to foster barriers of trade. The authors therefore highly
  appreciate the most recent activities of the sustainability of construction works
  (CEN/TC 350 committee http://portailgroupe.afnor.fr/public_espacenormalisation/CENTC350/index.html)
  currently workingon these issues at the EU level. Finally, the LCA community is
  further encouraged to increase the background life cycleinventory data and life
  cycle inventory modelling as well as the meaningfulness of certain environmental
  impact categories, such as toxicity, land use, biodiversity and resource usage.  '
