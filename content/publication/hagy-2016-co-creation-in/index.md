abstract: 'Â© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.Living Labs are places
  for open innovation where co-creation is a method for addressing real-life issues
  through the attribution of knowledge from science and society, the latter being
  a form of transdisciplinary social learning. In a Living Lab the representatives
  from business, society and academia, as well as citizens, have different value perceptions
  and propositions, providing heterogeneity across the stakeholder value spectrum.
  This provides a rich set of ideas and values for co-creation which can be used for
  both the operational phase and the integral shaping and creating the design for
  the physical infrastructure of the Living Lab itself. The use of co-creation workshops
  are demonstrated for ideation amongst the stakeholders for the HSB Living Lab. This
  is exemplified in the development of the social washing room which will be prototyped
  and tested in a fit-for-purpose multifunctional design space.  '
