abstract: 'Urban building-stocks use a significant amount of resources and energy.
  At the same time, theyhave a large potential for energy efficiency measures (EEM).
  To support decision-making and planning, spatial building-stock models are used
  to examine the current state and future development of urbanbuilding-stocks. While
  these models normally focus on specific cities, generic and broad stakeholder groups
  such as planners and policy makers are often targeted. Consequently, the visualization
  and communication of results are not tailored to these stakeholders. The aim of
  this paper is to explore the possibilities of mapping and representing energy use
  of urban building-stocks at different levels of aggregation and spatial distributions,
  to communicate with specific stakeholders involved in the urban development process.
  This paper uses a differentiated building-stock description based on building-specific
  data andmeasured energy use fromenergy performance certificates formulti-family
  buildings (MFB) in the city of Gothenburg. The building-stock description treats
  every building as unique, allowing results to be provided at any level of aggregation
  to suit the needs of the specific stakeholders involved. Calculated energy use of
  the existing stock is within 10% of the measured energy use. The potential for EEM
  in the existing stock is negated by the increased energy use due to new construction
  until 2035, using a development scenario based on current renovation rates and planned
  developments. Visualizations of the current energy use of the stock as well as the
  impact of renovation and new construction are provided, targeting specific local
  stakeholders.  '
