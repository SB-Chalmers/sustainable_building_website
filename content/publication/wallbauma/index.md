abstract: "By definition, life cycle management (LCM) is a framework “of concepts,\
  \ techniques, and procedures to address environmental, economic, technological,\
  \ and social aspects of products and organizations in order to achieve continuous\
  \ ‘sustainable' improvement from a life cycle perspective” (Hunkeler et al. 2001).\
  \ Thus, LCM theoretically integrates all sustainability dimensions, and strives\
  \ to provide a holistic perspective. It also assists in the efficient and effective\
  \ use of constrained natural and financial resources to reduce negative impacts\
  \ on society (Sonnemann and Leeuw 2006; Adibi et al. 2015). The LCM of infrastructures\
  \ is the adaptation of product life cycle management (PLM) as techniques to the\
  \ design, construction, and management of infrastructures. Infrastructure life cycle\
  \ management requires accurate and extensive information that might be generated\
  \ through different kinds of intelligent and connected information workflows, such\
  \ as building information modeling (BIM).  "
