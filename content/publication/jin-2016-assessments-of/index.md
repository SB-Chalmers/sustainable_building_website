abstract: 'The indoor environmental quality is of major interest for occupants in
  office buildings. This study is to identify the benchmarking values of physical
  parameters for indoor environmental quality (IEQ) of office buildings and explore
  the influences of outer climate conditions on the perceived IEQ. The recommended
  values from selected research articles are compared and classified in different
  hierarchies against thermal environment satisfaction level, air quality, illuminance
  and acoustic. A case study in five office buildings carried out in Switzerland is
  analysed from onsite physical measurements and occupant questionnaires. The results
  summarize the optimal ranges of selected physical parameters with three IEQ comfort
  levels. The differential and consistent outcomes in previous studies are verified.
  Outer climate parameters show potential correlations and influences with the satisfaction
  of IEQ aspects and weighting factors. In conclusion, it is lacking a standardized
  index and clear benchmarking values regarding both criteria requirements and local
  information.  '
