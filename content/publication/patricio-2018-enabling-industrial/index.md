abstract: 'Small and Medium Enterprises make up the vast majority of the businesses
  within the European Union, and are consequently important contributors to local
  and regional well-being. Nevertheless, Small and Medium Enterprises face many challenges
  when it comes to fostering innovation and improving environmental performance as
  part of their day-to-day activities. In parallel, the global consumption of raw
  materials is increasing, which makes it necessary to define and establish strategies
  to reduce the amount of, and dependence on, raw material extraction and imports,
  whilst also improving the sustainability of SMEs. In this context it is essential
  to promote circular economy strategies, such as industrial symbiosis partnerships,
  where companies use the waste products of other industries as raw materials. To
  achieve this, there is a need to find enablers to support industrial symbiosis collaborations
  among SMEs. These could include regional developers and local authorities. The aims
  of this study are to investigate whether industrial symbiosis is already a common
  practice within SMEs in the Västra Götaland Region of Sweden, as well as identifying
  barriers and motivations for partnerships. For this purpose, case studies of two
  industries were carried out: beer production and mushroom farming. Information was
  collected using on-site visits and semi-structured interviews, and the key findings
  where combined with a literature review, then used to propose new industrial symbiosis
  opportunities. The results show that industrial symbiosis is already used by some
  of the beer and mushroom producers. Economic gains and better environmental performance
  were presented as the main motivations for the companies to be involved in these
  partnerships. Nevertheless, industrial symbiosis could be extended to also include
  those companies that do not yet share their waste, mostly due to a lack of time
  or knowledge. Consequently, the study suggests potential industrial symbiosis partnerships
  that could be implemented within a short period of time, and be used by the local
  authorities to help SMEs to achieve circularity of wastes. Future work considers
  the dissemination of the results among SMEs as well as apply the approach to other
  types of industries operating in the region to identify additional IS potential
  partnerships.  '
