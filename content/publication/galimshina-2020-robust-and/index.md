abstract: 'Building renovation is currently urgent in order to decrease the energy
  consumption of a building stock. In order to achieve robust renovation scenarios,
  uncertainty quantification is needed. Climate change scenarios are important factors
  and need to be included in the analysis. In this paper, three climate change scenarios
  are applied probabilistically for a renovation scenario using dimensionality reduction
  techniques and further uncertainty propagation. The results show that RCP2.6 provides
  more robust results and saves on average 2.10^5 CHF and 2.10^5kgCO2eq. in a building
  life cycle comparing to RCP 8.5. The analysis under climate change is also compared
  to the probabilistic calculations under current climate and the results show the
  underestimation of both costs and environmental impacts when climate change is not
  included. It can also be clearly seen that even under the best case of RCP 2.6,
  building renovation is urgently needed to decrease the environmental impacts and
  costs.  '
