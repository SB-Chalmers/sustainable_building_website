abstract: 'The recycling of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is important
  due to its content of valuable and hazardous compounds. This study investigates
  the case of the recent technology change within television sets (TVs) and monitors,
  its impact on the generation of WEEE, and the implications for the recycling industry.
  In particular, material flow analysis for the time series of 1996-2014 for TVs and
  monitors by type of technology (CRT, Plasma and LCD) in physical units is combined
  with empirical data on product lifespans. The number of consumed TVs and monitors
  has grown exponentially. As a result, despite a 3-fold reduction in the weight of
  the products, the weight of the corresponding WEEE is also growing exponentially.
  Out with the old, out with the new - a peak in VVEEE from both CRT and flatscreen
  displays is expected during 2014-2020, due tothe simultaneous obsolesce of the last
  wave of CRT products and the short-lived flat-screen products that substituted the
  CRTs. The lifespans of LCD and LED TVs were found to be three times shorter than
  of the CRT TVs, with many TVs discarded while still functional. This is the consequence
  of two events - replacement of the CRT TVs in combination with lifestyle purchases
  of TVs, i.e. the premature replacement of flat-screen displays with new sets with
  extra-large screens and/or new features. The throughput of TVs and monitors consumed
  has been estimated annually from 2014 until 2040, by quantity and type of device,
  as well as by component and material type. The annual economic value of the corresponding
  secondary materials, by material type, has also been estimated. The point in time
  when the final disposal of CRT products is likely to take place has been identified
  and should be noted by the recycling industry. Among the important contributions
  of this study to the accounting and predicting of amounts and types of WEEE are
  the lifespan distributions, size and weight distributions, and material composition
  for TVs and monitors of different technology. Directions for method application
  in other countries are given.  '
