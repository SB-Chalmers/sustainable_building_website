abstract: 'An infrastructure system – here, the industrial ecology of Gothenburg —
  is more important for society than we usually credit it for (cf. Technology is society
  made durable, Latour 1990) and is taken for granted by most inhabitants. Gothenburg
  is an unusually well-developed and interconnected infrastructure system. The first
  district heating facility was put in operation in 1952. Soon enough, waste was re-used
  and recycled into energy, into both electricity and heat. With time, more varied
  materials and sources became integrated into the system to also produce biogas and
  compost. The project makes a historiographic description of how the industrial ecology
  of the Gothenburg city region developed since the Gothenburg technical environmental
  flow system is unique in size, age, diversity of flows and functions. The study
  describes environmental flows and their actors in a networked organization. The
  focus on interconnectivity of the different actors, flows and sectors of Gothenburg
  requires the combination of several theoretical fields. Such theoretical fields
  include Networked Learning, which takes a relational stance in which learning takes
  place both in relation to others, and in relation to learning resources (Dirckinck-Homfeld
  et al., 2009); STS (Science Technology and Society), which study how technical innovation
  are affected by social, political and cultural values, and how these innovation
  affect, in turn, political, social and cultural values; (Joerges & Novotny, 2003);
  and Urban Metabolism, which uses models to facilitate the description and analysis
  of the flows of the energy and materials within cities, such as Material Flow Analysis
  of a city, and provides a metaphorical framework to study the interactions of natural
  and human systems in specific regions. Preliminary findings will be presented.  '
