abstract: Â© 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers. Current studies and performance
  labels focus mainly on the operational energy demand of buildings due to heating,
  cooling, ventilation, lighting, and hot water, but they rarely account for embodied
  impacts. Performing a life cycle assessment (LCA) on an entire building structure,
  let alone a building, requires time and data, both of which are often lacking for
  practitioners in the construction industry. Limited knowledge on the embodied carbon
  equivalent of building structures led to the benchmarking effort of the database
  of embodied quantity outputs (DEQO), developed by the first author over the last
  6 years in close collaboration with industry and academia. DEQO collects material
  quantities for existing buildings in a robust way directly from industry. This paper
  presents the lessons learned from this database to define the next steps for structural
  engineers to lower the environmental impacts related to the material quantities
  in their projects. To create confidence and comparability in the results, recommendations
  are given such as implementing uncertainty analysis into practice to avoid inaccurate
  comparisons with a false sense of precision.
