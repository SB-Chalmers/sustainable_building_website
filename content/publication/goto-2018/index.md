abstract: Standards and design codes are necessary to guarantee the desired safety
  and performance of structures. With regard to timber structures, considerable differences
  exist in the standards and design codes between Europe and Japan. In this contribution
  the framework of standards and design codes in Europe and Japan is explained and
  compared. As an example, the particular situation on the evaluation of new types
  of self-tapping screws is discussed in depth. The building tradition in the different
  countries is presented taking into account the ongoing technological developments.
  Potential optimization of different standards is suggested. Â© WCTE 2018 Committee.
