abstract: Researchers have capitalized on microblogging services, such as Twitter,
  for detecting and monitoring real world events. Existing approaches have based their
  conclusions on data collected by monitoring a set of pre-defined keywords. In this
  paper, we show that this manner of data collection risks losing a significant amount
  of relevant information. We then propose an adaptive crawling model that detects
  emerging popular hashtags, and monitors them to retrieve greater amounts of highly
  associated data for events of interest. The proposed model analyzes the traffic
  patterns of the hashtags collected from the live stream to update subsequent collection
  queries. To evaluate this adaptive crawling model, we apply it to a dataset collected
  during the 2012 London Olympic Games. Our analysis shows that adaptive crawling
  based on the proposed Refined Keyword Adaptation algorithm collects a more comprehensive
  dataset than pre-defined keyword crawling, while only introducing a minimum amount
  of noise. Copyright 2013 ACM.
