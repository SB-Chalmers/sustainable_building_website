abstract: 'Innovation in construction is becoming increasingly important. Many studies
  on construction innovation focus either on the project level or on top management.
  In doing so, the in between group of midlevel managers risks to be neglected. If
  studied, middle managers are often narrowly defined to fit the mechanistic implementation
  of top management ideas. This does injustice to the importance of middle managers
  and the variety of their roles in innovation. In this paper, we address the different
  roles that middle managers may adopt in relation to innovation. A literature review
  and a case study were conducted at a regional housing division of a large Swedish
  contractor. In 10 semi-structured interviews and a vision seminar the middle managers
  were asked to voice their perceptions about innovation in the division and about
  their own role. Systematisation of working practices, employee development, and
  health, safety and sustainability measures were perceived to be the most important
  innovations. Four different roles of the middle manager have been examined: implementer
  of change, networker, sensemaker and enabler. Most middle managers identified with
  different mixtures of these ideal types. On this background, we discuss how middle
  managers may advance these roles to contribute to innovation in housing construction.'
