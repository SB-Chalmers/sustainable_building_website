abstract: Treatment of deinking waste-water with chemical coagulation and activated
  sludge method is investigated. SS, BOD5 and CODCr of deinking waste-water are determined.
  Satisfactory results of removing 93.5% SS, 19.8% BOD5 and 65.0% CODCr are claimed
  for the coagulation stage; whereas during the second stage of activated sludge treatment,
  removals of BOD5 and CODCr are reported to be more than 50% and 70% respectively.
  It is also confirmed that continuous operation of activated sludge is feasible.
