 abstract = {Treatment of deinking waste-water with chemical coagulation and activated sludge method is investigated. SS, BOD5 and CODCr of deinking waste-water are determined. Satisfactory results of removing 93.5% SS, 19.8% BOD5 and 65.0% CODCr are claimed for the coagulation stage; whereas during the second stage of activated sludge treatment, removals of BOD5 and CODCr are reported to be more than 50% and 70% respectively. It is also confirmed that continuous operation of activated sludge is feasible.},
