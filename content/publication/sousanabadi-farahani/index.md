abstract: 'In strategic planning, maintenance and renovation plans serve as an instrument
  for multiple objectives (e.g., to control degradation, sustain optimal building
  performance, reduce the costs of operations, and meet budget requirements, etc.).
  The lack of a proper long-term plan can lead to financial difficulties, especially
  in older buildings where the components are old and in need of extensive maintenance
  and renovation. These difficulties are complex and more pronounced in less-attractive
  markets where maintenance and renovation budgets are limited and socioeconomic issues
  are prevalent. In order to address the complexity of the problem and fully utilize
  the potential value in buildings, multiobjective analyses of maintenance and renovation
  plans need to be carried out together with proper life expectancy analyses. Current
  planning methods are not flexible or efficient enough to combine life expectancy
  analyses with multiobjective optimization processes. This paper presents a maintenance
  and renovation scheduling method that utilizes a modified deterioration function
  for life expectancy analyses and combines it with a service life-cycle cost analysis
  to facilitate multiobjective optimization processes. To demonstrate its application,
  the proposed method is used for maintenance and renovation planning for two identical
  buildings of different ages. To further demonstrate its economic benefits, the proposed
  method is used for planning under a restricting annual budget constraint and the
  results are compared to the results from a conventional method used by the managing
  company. The proposed planning method helps decision makers choose maintenance and
  renovation strategies in difficult market situations and/or under budget constraints.  '
