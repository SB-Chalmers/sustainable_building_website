abstract: "The building construction industry is in need of sustainable materials\
  \ and solutions. A novel building material, such as textile-reinforced concrete\
  \ (TRC), could be used to meet this demand. TRC is a combination of fine-grained\
  \ concrete and multi-axial textile fabrics, which has been fundamentally researched\
  \ over the past decade. TRC-based research has explored various facets of this composite\
  \ material, such as its structural functionality, production, applicability and\
  \ design. One key aspect that is still missing, however, is a comprehensive review\
  \ of the sustainable potential of this material in terms of its input-output and\
  \ durability which suitably answers to requirement no.7 of EU's Construction Products\
  \ Regulation. This article provides qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the\
  \ sustainable potential and prospective development of TRC particularly reinforced\
  \ by alkali-resistant (AR) glass, carbon or basalt fibers. Based on the outcome\
  \ of this evaluation, carbon textile fibers were observed to hold the optimal potential\
  \ mechanical behavior; additionally, it was revealed through the conducted Life\
  \ Cycle Assessment (LCA), that basalt had the least cumulative energy demand while\
  \ carbon had the least environmental impact.  "
