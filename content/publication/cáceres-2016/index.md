abstract: "Given the high impact that air leaks have on buildings' energy expenses,\
  \ most developed countries have set out norms which regulate their presence in homes.\
  \ Chile will soon begin this process; however, the airtightness revision strategy\
  \ in envelopes has not been resolved as of yet. This article presents a tool to\
  \ Assess Airtightness in Design, EHeD. The software will allow predicting the performance\
  \ of homes under the regulations which will be set out, aiding designers, builders\
  \ or owners to make decisions when making changes to improve airtightness. EHeD\
  \ has been validated through pressurization tests in diverse homes across the country,\
  \ with results that are in line with expectations, thus validating its calculation\
  \ model. The methodology considers three stages: determining the main factors that\
  \ have an impact on the airtightness in Chilean homes, preparing an airtightness\
  \ database for each component (wall, windows and doors) and preparing a calculation\
  \ model that is integrated in an IT interface. © 2016 by the authors."
