abstract: 'International bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
  or the United Nations agree in seeing the built environment as one of the key sectors
  to mitigate emissions. Cost abatement curves as generated by McKinsey list a number
  of technologies in the building sector, which are already cost effective and are
  together potentially allowing for carbon mitigations of 2,0-3,0 Gtons of CO2eq per
  annum. Despite being economically attractive as well as desirable from a climate
  change mitigation viewpoint, almost none of these technologies are massively upscaling.
  The European Union requires the individual member countries to implement measures
  to speed up energy efficiency in the building sector. Each country however is free
  on the exact way how to do so as long as its specific approach is in line with the
  general EU road-map. This paper assesses the effect of the implemented frameworks
  for France and Germany and draws conclusions regarding immediate and future phenomenon.
  Findings are that both countries have implemented holistic frameworks that include
  legal standards, financial incentives and market education. While the German setup
  focuses on systemic solutions though, France promotes a component based subsidy
  scheme. In both countries the refurbishment rate on a component level is substantially
  higher than for deep renovation with window exchange and roof refurbishment being
  the most commonly implemented ones. Component based measures are higher in France
  than in Germany, in some cases even meeting the aimed for 3% needed for a refurbishment
  of the complete building stock by 2050 on an EU level. In general however both countries
  fail to achieve refurbishment and renovation rates that enable them to stand up
  to the EU 2050 targets yet, indicating that the market barrier and mechanisms have
  to be monitored and understood better to implement massive up-scaling of energy
  efficient technologies.  '
