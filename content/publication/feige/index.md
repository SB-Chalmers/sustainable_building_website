abstract: "Given the centrality of the price mechanism to resource allocation in market\
  \ economies, the effect of sustainable construction on real estate prices has become\
  \ an increasingly important empirical issue for market participants and policy makers\
  \ in the real estate sector. Drawing upon a sample of approximately 2500 residential\
  \ building units in Switzerland, this study assesses the effects of buildings' sustainability\
  \ on their rental prices. In contrast to the vast majority of previous studies that\
  \ have focused on the price effects of eco-labels, this study investigates the effects\
  \ of individual sustainability attributes. Overall, we find a positive relationship\
  \ between the environmental performance of residential buildings and their rental\
  \ levels. Sustainable building characteristics, especially those which enhance the\
  \ water efficiency, the health and comfort level and the building's safety and security,\
  \ have significant positive price effects. It is argued that the unexpected negative\
  \ relationship between energy performance and rental prices is attributed to the\
  \ bundling of energy costs and rents in Swiss lease structures.  "
