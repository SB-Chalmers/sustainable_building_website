abstract: 'Industrial Symbiosis (IS) can reduce industrial waste and the need for
  virgin material extraction by utilizing waste generated by one industry as a raw
  material for another. Input-output matching is a commonly used approach for identifying
  potential IS partnerships. Usually, to collect necessary data for input-output matching,
  companies are asked to participate in workshops or surveys. However, such activities
  can be costly and time consuming. Additionally, companies may be unwilling to participate
  due to issues around data confidentiality. This article aims to show how these barriers
  can be overcome by a new method for identification of IS opportunities, which does
  not require companies to be surveyed. The developed matching approach uses statistical
  datasets and IS databases. The underlying principle is to use known IS partnerships
  and databases developed by the authors containing data on typical waste generation
  and resource use by industries, to expand and link other potential donors and receivers.
  This allows the expansion of one IS example into multiple potential relationships.
  The method promotes Circular Economy development by identifying more opportunities
  to utilize more secondary resources through connecting previously unrelated industry
  sectors. The method has been tested in Sweden, where the goal was to identify potential
  partnerships between industries that generate sawdust as a waste product and companies
  that could utilize sawdust in their industrial processes. Out of 6,726,534 potential
  symbiotic links identified by the method, 159,630 were shortlisted using prioritization
  criteria reflecting an increased likelihood of symbiosis.  '
