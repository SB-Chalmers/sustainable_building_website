abstract: The dissimilar materials such as the plastic molded LSI package and metal/ceramic
  bonded joint suffer a severe thermal stress concentration at the edge or corner
  of the interface due to the mismatch of materials and sometimes fracture from the
  point. In this study, the stress singularity at an interface edge and also at a
  tip of the interface crack under thermal stresses or the bonded residual stresses
  is investigated theoretically and numerically. It is found that the stress singularity
  under thermal stresses is quite different from that under the applied loadings without
  the thermal or residual stresses and in some cases the logarithmic singularity appears
  at the interface edge. Some bi-material problems with various material combinations
  and the shape of edge are analyzed by the boundary element method and the singularity
  of the thermal stress is discussed.
