 abstract = {The dissimilar materials such as the plastic molded LSI package and metal/ceramic bonded joint suffer a severe thermal stress concentration at the edge or corner of the interface due to the mismatch of materials and sometimes fracture from the point. In this study, the stress singularity at an interface edge and also at a tip of the interface crack under thermal stresses or the bonded residual stresses is investigated theoretically and numerically. It is found that the stress singularity under thermal stresses is quite different from that under the applied loadings without the thermal or residual stresses and in some cases the logarithmic singularity appears at the interface edge. Some bi-material problems with various material combinations and the shape of edge are analyzed by the boundary element method and the singularity of the thermal stress is discussed.},
