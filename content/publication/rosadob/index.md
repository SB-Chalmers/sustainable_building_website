abstract: "Knowledge about the characteristics and driving forces of material flows\
  \ in urban areas is crucial, as the pathways towards sustainability depend on local\
  \ conditions. Currently, Urban Metabolism research focuses on the analysis of trends\
  \ and transitions in different stages of city development, on developing classification\
  \ systems and identification of metabolism profiles for urban areas.A novel framework\
  \ for characterizing cities metabolism is provided using Urban Material Flow Accounting\
  \ indicators as the basis. A Material Flow Accounting study is conducted for three\
  \ cities in Sweden, from 1996 until 2011: Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo. Based\
  \ on the urban metabolism characteristics framework, three distinct profiles are\
  \ proposed: consumer-service; industrial; and transitioning.Stockholm's material\
  \ needs are mainly for final consumption. When compared with the other two cities,\
  \ material flows follow a more stable trend and have lower dependency on external\
  \ systems due to the marginal production and export of goods.Gothenburg has the\
  \ most resource intensive metabolism. It requires several times larger material\
  \ inputs than the other two cities and produces much larger outputs, for benefit\
  \ of the rest of the country and the world. Consequently, CO2 emissions are higher\
  \ in Gothenburg.Malmo characteristics are more complex than Stockholm's with higher\
  \ material needs in particular construction minerals. Its dependency on external\
  \ flows is low, due to the fact that the economy and exports are based on domestically\
  \ extracted Non-Metallic Minerals and Biomass.  "
