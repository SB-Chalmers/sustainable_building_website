abstract: 'Conventional heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems
  are designed to condition the entire building volume. In contrast, Personal Comfort
  Systems (PCS) target conditioning only the occupied zones of the space, while maintaining
  the remaining volume at a relatively under-conditioned state. PCS offer the occupants
  the choice of modulating their immediate thermal ambience with local controls. The
  individual-level control helps in improving the subjective thermal and air quality
  acceptability with the desired thermal sensation. This review paper details on the
  various types of heating, cooling, ventilation, heating with ventilation, and cooling
  with ventilation PCS devices. It summarises the thermal ambience created by the
  respective PCS devices and the resultant subjective responses of the occupants.
  This review also identifies the energy saving potential of various kinds of PCS
  devices, the power use of PCS devices, and discusses their economic viability.  '
