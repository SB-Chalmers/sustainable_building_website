abstract: 'In the past decade, palladium-catalyzed C-H activation/C-C bond-forming
  reactions have emerged as promising new catalytic transformations; however, development
  in this field is still at an early stage compared to the state of the art in cross-coupling
  reactions using aryl and alkyl halides. This Review begins with a brief introduction
  of four extensively investigated modes of catalysis for forming C-C bonds from C-H
  bonds: Pd11ZPd0, Pd11ZPdZ Pd0PdII PdIV. and Pd 0PdII catalysis. A more detailed
  discussion is then directed towards the recent development of palladium(II)catalyzed
  coupling of C-H bonds with organometallic reagents through a PdIIPd0 catalytic cycle.
  Despite the progress made to date, improving the versatility and practicality of
  this new reaction remains a tremendous challenge. Â© 2009 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp;
