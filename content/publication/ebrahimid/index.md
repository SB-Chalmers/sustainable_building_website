abstract: "Purpose: This study aims to establish a regionalized environmental impact\
  \ assessment of construction machinery equipped with diesel engines certified by\
  \ the European emission standard Stage V, and operated in cold climatic zones in\
  \ Europe. Method: The study quantifies potential environmental impacts associated\
  \ with construction machinery over the entire lifecycle, from extraction of materials\
  \ to the end-of-life. For the operation phase, a meso-level emission accounting\
  \ method is applied to quantify tailpipe emissions for certain subcategories of\
  \ construction machinery. This is achieved by determining the operational efficiency\
  \ of each machine in terms of effective hours. The quantified emission data are\
  \ then adjusted based on engine deterioration models to estimate the rate of increase\
  \ in emissions throughout the lifetime of each machine. Finally, the CML impact\
  \ assessment method is applied to inventory data to quantify potential environmental\
  \ impacts. Results: The study shows that tailpipe emissions, which largely depend\
  \ on an engine's fuel consumption, had the largest contribution to environmental\
  \ impacts in most impact categories. At the same time, there was a positive correlation\
  \ between the operation weight and the impacts of the machinery. Also, machinery\
  \ with similar operation weight had relatively similar impact patterns due to similar\
  \ driving factors and dependencies. In addition, network, sensitivity, and uncertainty\
  \ analyses were performed to quantify the source of impacts and validate the robustness\
  \ of the study. Results of the sensitivity analysis showed that the responsiveness\
  \ of the studied systems is very sensitive to changes in the amount of fuel consumption.\
  \ In addition, the uncertainty results showed that the domain of uncertainty increased\
  \ as the operation weight subcategory of machinery increased. Conclusion: This study\
  \ extends previous work on the life cycle assessment (LCA) of construction machinery,\
  \ and the methodology developed provides a basis for future extension and improvement\
  \ in this field. The use of effective hours as the unit of operational efficiency\
  \ helps to resolve uncertainties linked to lifetime and annual operation hours.\
  \ Also, the obtained results can be of use for decision support and for assessing\
  \ the impacts of transition from fossil fuels to alternative fuel types.  "
