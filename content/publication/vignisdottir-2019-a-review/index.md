abstract: 'The need for winter road maintenance (WRM) is changing in cold regions
  due to climate change. How the different modes of WRM will contribute to future
  overall emissions from infrastructure is therefore of great interest to road owners
  with a view to a more sustainable, low-carbon future. In the quest for near-zero-emissions
  transport, all aspects of the transport sector need to be accounted for in the search
  for possible mitigation of emissions. This study used 35 peer-reviewed articles
  published between 2000 and 2018 to map available information on the environmental
  impacts and effect of WRM and reveal any research gaps. The articles were categorized
  according to their research theme and focus. They were found to focus mainly on
  the local effects of WRM with emphasis on effects on water. Of the reviewed works,
  27 contain information related to the environmental effects of deicers on a local
  level while five focused on global impact, which was mainly caused by fuel consumption.
  Only two articles took a holistic look at the system to identify emission sources
  and the effectiveness of possible changes in operations methods or material selection.
  In conclusion, WRM would benefit from further research to understand how it affects
  the natural environment in regions with a cold climate. Furthermore, a life-cycle
  approach could reveal ways to mitigate emissions through effectively comparing possible
  changes in the system without shifting the problem to other aspects of road transport.  '
