abstract: "To examine thermal comfort and the corresponding physiological responses\
  \ in non-uniform and dynamic indoor thermal environments,this article presents the\
  \ investigation of thermal sensations and skin temperatures during step changes\
  \ between the ambient environment and the workstation where local ventilation devices\
  \ supplied air motion around the subjects' heads. Twenty-three labtests with human\
  \ subjects were conducted to provide summer cooling in a controlled-environment\
  \ chamber. Overall thermal sensations and skin temperatures were collected and analyzed.\
  \ Data collected as subjects stepped between the ambient environment and the controlled-environment\
  \ workstation displayed hysteresis and overshooting. That facial skin temperature\
  \ correlates with thermal sensation provides a causal explanation of the overshooting\
  \ and hysteresis. Further, the minimum change on facial skin temperature required\
  \ to register a just-noticeable difference on thermal sensation was calculated to\
  \ explore the correlation between facial skintemperature and overall thermal senation.\
  \ In conclusion, thermal sensation data provide a sound quantifiable foundation\
  \ for comfortpositive non-uniform indoor thermal environments. Facial skin temperature\
  \ explains thermal sensation's changing characteristics during step changes in non-uniform\
  \ thermal environments under varying local cooling methods.  "
