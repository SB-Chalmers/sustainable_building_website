abstract: 'Entity recognition of Chinese is a bask test for natural language entity,
  and Chinese entity recognition of mobile phone is also an issue for natural language
  proceeding. Our works is focus on retrieve and applications for mobile phone platform
  entity. The main points of this paper include: 1. Construction of knowledge based
  for Chinese entity recognition. 2. We use conditional random field (CRF) by probabilistic
  models to segment and label sequence data. 3. There are many applications can be
  found based on relation extraction. In this paper we just description two applications,
  entity search engines and Smartphone. Â© 2011 IEEE.'
