 abstract = {Entity recognition of Chinese is a bask test for natural language entity, and Chinese entity recognition of mobile phone is also an issue for natural language proceeding. Our works is focus on retrieve and applications for mobile phone platform entity. The main points of this paper include: 1. Construction of knowledge based for Chinese entity recognition. 2. We use conditional random field (CRF) by probabilistic models to segment and label sequence data. 3. There are many applications can be found based on relation extraction. In this paper we just description two applications, entity search engines and Smartphone. Â© 2011 IEEE.},
