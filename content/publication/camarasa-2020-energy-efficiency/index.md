abstract: 'In line with EU Directives, European building portfolio owners are required
  to bring their stock to nearly Zero Energy Building (nZEB) standards by 2050. To
  fulfil this goal in a timely and cost-effective manner, they will need to have a
  comprehensive understanding of their buildings’ condition, as well as consistent
  information on viable energy and low-carbon technology measures. Currently, in Europe,
  there is a lack of knowledge of what energy efficiency measures are being implemented
  in residential buildings. It is also unknown what are the decision-making processes
  behind the selection of these measures. On this basis, the aim of this study is
  to shed light on (1) what energy efficiency measures are currently carried out across
  European building portfolio owners (BPOs), (2) how are these measures selected (i.e.
  decisionmaking processes and information sources), and (3) what data would be needed
  to foster the uptake of low carbon energy efficiency technologies. The applied methodology
  combines desk research on scientific and grey literature, with findings in the field
  of building maintenance & operation. The later based on semi-structured interviews
  with 23 selected private and public BPOs across 7 European countries: Sweden, UK,
  Germany, Denmark, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. Results show that the most often
  implemented actions are the maintenance of the roof and the upgrade of the heating
  system. Measures are decided based on a combined planned and “reactive” (i.e. problem/solution)
  approach. The data that is typically used by BPOs is basic building information,
  such as gross floor area or year built. Although currently unavailable, the most
  often solicited evidence by the BPOS in favour of energy efficiency and low carbon
  technology measures is related to energy consumption and other user data.  '
