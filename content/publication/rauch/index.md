abstract: "Increased precipitation and risk of flooding are major effects due to climate\
  \ change that Swedish municipalities need to consider, while facing an ongoing growth\
  \ in population and densification of urban areas. In this context, urban stormwater\
  \ management represents a growing challenge. The vulnerability of the society towards\
  \ climate change depends on the capability of the city to responds to environmental\
  \ issues. This report presents the challenges and the needs for the implementation\
  \ of sustainable stormwater solutions encountered in the urban planning process\
  \ for the city of Gothenburg. The decision making process can be facilitated by\
  \ the adoption of a stormwater toolbox, which functionalities are designed to support\
  \ the stakeholders at each step of the planning process. The modules of the toolbox\
  \ should be designed around a collaboration platform that assists with transparent\
  \ information flows and allocation of responsibilities. The specific modules (e.g.\
  \ hydrology, cost-benefit analysis, experience database) should support the needs\
  \ along the different phases in the process. This study was financially supported\
  \ by Climate KIC. The Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) are partnerships\
  \ set up by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, EIT, that bring\
  \ together businesses, research centers and universities with the purpose of developing\
  \ innovative products and services, starting new companies and training a new generation\
  \ of entrepreneurs. EIT Climate-KIC's mission is to bring together, inspire and\
  \ empower a dynamic community to build a zero carbon economy and climate resilient\
  \ society and to enable Europe to lead the global transformation towards sustainability.\
