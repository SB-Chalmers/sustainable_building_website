 abstract = {Increased precipitation and risk of flooding are major effects due to climate change that Swedish municipalities need to consider, while facing an ongoing growth in population and densification of urban areas. In this context, urban stormwater management represents a growing challenge. The vulnerability of the society towards climate change depends on the capability of the city to responds to environmental issues. This report presents the challenges and the needs for the implementation of sustainable stormwater solutions encountered in the urban planning process for the city of Gothenburg. The decision making process can be facilitated by the adoption of a stormwater toolbox, which functionalities are designed to support the stakeholders at each step of the planning process. The modules of the toolbox should be designed around a collaboration platform that assists with transparent information flows and allocation of responsibilities. The specific modules (e.g. hydrology, cost-benefit analysis, experience database) should support the needs along the different phases in the process. This study was financially supported by Climate KIC. The Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) are partnerships set up by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, EIT, that bring together businesses, research centers and universities with the purpose of developing innovative products and services, starting new companies and training a new generation of entrepreneurs. EIT Climate-KIC's mission is to bring together, inspire and empower a dynamic community to build a zero carbon economy and climate resilient society and to enable Europe to lead the global transformation towards sustainability.  },
