abstract: 'Current debates about a more sustainable energy system strongly emphasise
  the role of CO2 emissions and climate change. Without denying the urgency of reducing
  CO2 emissions, it is important to recognise that this is only one of several categories
  of requirements for creating a more sustainable energy system. This chapter discusses
  three of these categories: (1) access and security, (2) climate change and environmental
  impact,(3) economic and social development. The problem of dealing with three different
  perspectives is illustrated with reference to the development of concentrated solar
  power. It is clear that a more sustainable energy system cannot be achieved using
  the simple creed that renewables reduce CO2 emissions and are therefore good. Understanding
  the different issues that need addressing may not in itself resolve disagreement,
  but will at least create a common understanding of what is involved.  '
