 abstract = {Users have significant impacts on building energy consumption and can interact with indoor environments. Identifying user needs, behaviour, and preference is crucial for the design of both new and the renovation of existing buildings. Offices are important since people spend on average one-third of their life at work. It also accounted for a larger share of the energy use and the floor area of non-residential buildings in Europe. Moreover, more ambitious regulations and the increasing popularity of voluntary building certification schemes require the construction of more energy-efficient buildings, but in reality, a ‘performance gap' is often observed. Therefore, deep insights in user perceptions and experiences can provide the knowledge basis for developing a new generation of office buildings that provide a healthier and more productive indoor environment guided by a user-centric approach. In  his article, we will introduce the web-based application of the Questionnaire and Diary Apps and a Virtual Reality (VR) design tool developed to support the interactive co-creation session with users and designers.  },
