abstract: 'Human health and well-being have gained growing attention in the societal
  debate as well as in research. It is widely acknowledged that employees’ health
  and well-being contribute to a decent work environment which can positively contribute
  to economic benefits for the employers, the social-welfare and health system as
  well as the building owners. However, the office environment is complex and constitutes
  of various factors affecting employees’ health and well-being, for example, indoor
  climate, architectural design, and social work environment. Therefore, this paper
  will focus on indoor environmental quality (IEQ) and workplace design, and their
  influence on employees’ health and work performance. A multi-disciplinary approach
  is developed integrating the subjective survey, semi-structured interview, and physical
  measurement for an in-depth investigation of the physical office environment and
  employees’ self-reported health and work performance. A large office building with
  BREEAM certification has been studied at the end of summer in 2019. In total, 160
  employees were involved by an online-based survey and individual interview and workshop.
  The main aspects of IEQ were measured, including the thermal environment, air quality,
  acoustic and lighting. The correlations between IEQ and workspace design factors
  and 5-symptom based self-reported health and self-reported work performance concerning
  self-evaluation and leader’s feedback were studied. Results show that physical office
  environment shows a large association with self-reported health and self-reported
  work performance. IEQ factors of air quality and relative humidity are significantly
  correlated with PSI. Size of individual workspace and aesthetic appearance of the
  office gain the highest correlation with self-reported health status among the factors
  of workspace design. Noise and artificial lights are studied to be significantly
  associated with work performance, and distance between work desks is largely associated
  with work performance. Considering the needs of employees on the physical office
  environment, air temperature, air quality and availability to work concentrated
  still underperform but perceived as highly important by the employees. The study
  made efforts to study the complex factors existing in the office environment with
  a multi-disciplinary approach, which can be utilized in other case studies to evaluate
  office environment and identify the key factors. Thus, the study made it possible
  to review and compare the influence of physical environment factors affecting employees’
  health and well-being. The data collected will contribute to an office database
  which is under development by the authors.  '
