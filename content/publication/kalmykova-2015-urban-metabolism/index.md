abstract: 'Circular economy (CE) principles can be applied at different scales: from
  materials to products, from individual supply chains to industries, from cities
  to national and transnational economies. In order to design a CE at any scale, a
  system approach is needed to describe and analyse the current situation and to model
  and implement the transformations required. In this paper we show how Urban Metabolism
  (UM) research can support the design of CE in cities. Urban metabolism considers
  resource consumption and environmental pressure of urban areas in a systemic way.
  The Urban Metabolism Group at Chalmers is developing three alleys of research: UM
  description, analysis and sustainable UM design. Findings from each of these may
  inform CE design by for example: quantifying resource flows at the product and material
  levels and with respect to industries and other sectors using them; identifying
  possible links between stakeholders with suitable materials and infrastructures;
  connecting material flows with life cycle impacts for multidimensional priority
  setting; depicting the drivers of material flows; and modelling policy effects on
  material flows. In this way, urban metabolism research can provide a comprehensive
  framework to investigate the pathways to circularity at both the urban and regional
  level.  '
