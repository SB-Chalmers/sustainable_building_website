abstract: 'Performing a comprehensive emission accounting via monitoring equipment
  to survey the performance of machinery is often an intensive work and costly. This
  often requiring hours of measurements and a sufficient number of observations to
  obtain valid findings. The purpose of current work is to introduce a screening emission
  accounting as a way to have a quick overview of emissions associated with non-road
  mobile machinery by having a simplified assessment method. To meet this aim, this
  study uses documented data from performances of machinery and couples them with
  the recently published guidebook by the European Emission Agency. To map the results,
  operational performances of four wheel loaders operating in quarries to move stone
  materials are used, equipped with Stage IV engines and net power output in a range
  between 130 ≤ kW < 560. The obtained results showed that the positive correlation
  between an increase in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions is not changed. The
  mass of emissions, however, is better addressed if emissions are linked with the
  efficiency of equipment, instead of effective hour. Machinery that consumed less
  fuel per m3 moved volume of materials, resulted in having less emissions compared
  to those that had higher fuel consumption per m3 moved volume.  '
