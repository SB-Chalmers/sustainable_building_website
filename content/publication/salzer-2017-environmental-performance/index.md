abstract: 'Purpose The environmental impact of the social buildingstock is relevant,
  particularly in emerging economies. Life cycle thinking is not yet established,
  however. Locally available, alternative building concepts could potentially reduce
  the environmental impact of the construction segment. This paper examines the environmental
  performance of Bas-built low-cost housing for an example of the Philippines, and
  the potential to reduce its environmental impact through use of three alternative
  building technologies: cement–bamboo frames, soil–cement blocks, and coconut board-based
  housing.Methods Life cycle assessment models are implemented andevaluated with software
  SimaPro, using the single-impact indicators global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative
  energy demand (CED) and the multi-impact indicator Impact2002+. According to EN
  15978, the life cycle phase product and construction process (A), use stage (B),
  end-of-life (C) and supplementary information beyond the building life cycle (D)
  have been assessed. Theoretically calculated inflows from standard construction
  procedures used in phase A have been verified with 3 years of empirical data from
  implemented construction projects. For phases B, C and D, attention was given to
  servicelife, use-phase, allocation of waste products, biogenic carbon and land-use
  assumptions. Scenarios reflect the actual situation in the emerging economy. Processes,
  such as heat recovery from thermal utilization, which are not existing nor near
  to implementation, were excluded.Results and discussion For an assessment of the
  phases A–B–C–D with GWP, a 35% reduction of environmental impact for soil–cement
  blocks, 74%for cement–bamboo frame, and 83% for coconut board-based houses is obtained
  relative to a concrete reference house. In absolute terms, this relates to a reduction
  of 4.4, 9.3, and 10.3 t CO2 equivalents over a service life of 25 years. CED showed
  higher impacts for the biogenic construction methods coconut board and cement–bamboo
  frames of +8.0 and +4.7%, while the soil–cement technology was evaluated −7.1% compared
  to GWP. Sixteen of 17 midpoint categories of Impact2002+ confirmed an overall reduction
  potential of the alternative building methods, with the midpoint category land occupation
  being the exception rating the conventional practice over the alternatives.Conclusions
  It is concluded that the alternative construction technologies have substantial
  potential to reduce the environmental burden caused by the social housing sector.
  The service life of the alternative technologies plays a vital role for it. LCA
  for emerging economies needs to incorporate realistic scenarios applicable at their
  current state or belonging to the most probable alternatives to ensure valuable
  results.Recommendations for further research are provided.  '
