abstract: The vast majority of scientists and policy makers agree that environmental
  impacts of buildings need to be reduced significantly, and that Life Cycle Assessment
  (LCA) is a methodology well suited to support this. The importance of evaluating
  potential improvements to the environmental life cycle performance of buildings
  in early design stages is widely acknowledged; the wide application of LCA during
  design however, is restrained by the great uncertainty in design and material decisions
  at this stage. To support decision making in the early design stage, we propose
  an approach using Building Information Modeling (BIM) to assess a wide range of
  construction options and their embodied environmental impact. We use a conceptual
  BIM model to evaluate a variety of material compositions for different building
  elements and the potential contribution of elements to the total embodied impact
  of the building design. The BIM-integrated approach enables identification of design
  specific hotspots which can be visualized on the building model for communication
  of LCA results and visual design guidance.
