abstract: This article presents an overview of methods used by the Wuppertal Institute
  to determine sustainability targets in the construction sector and to develop pathways
  for achieving targeted improvements. Resource productivity is considered over a
  building's entire life cycle (MIPS). The COMPASS concept integrates environmental,
  economic and social aspects for single companies or industrial sectors in order
  to make progress towards greater sustainability. Profiting from each of these approaches,
  and based on various types of research, recommendations are derived for companies
  and policy makers. Multi-stakeholder processes can be used to promote overall sustainable
  development in the construction sector, and eventually to integrate concepts related
  specifically to the micro and meso levels.
