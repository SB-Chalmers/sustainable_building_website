abstract: 'Purpose: This study aims to establish a regionalized environmental impact
  assessment of construction machinery equipped with diesel engines certified by the
  European emission standard Stage V, and operated in cold climatic zones in Europe.
  Method: The study quantifies potential environmental impacts associated with construction
  machinery over the entire lifecycle, from extraction of materials to the end-of-life.
  For the operation phase, a meso-level emission accounting method is applied to quantify
  tailpipe emissions for certain subcategories of construction machinery. This is
  achieved by determining the operational efficiency of each machine in terms of effective
  hours. The quantified emission data are then adjusted based on engine deterioration
  models to estimate the rate of increase in emissions throughout the lifetime of
  each machine. Finally, the CML impact assessment method is applied to inventory
  data to quantify potential environmental impacts. Results: The study shows that
  tailpipe emissions, which largely depend on an engine’s fuel consumption, had the
  largest contribution to environmental impacts in most impact categories. At the
  same time, there was a positive correlation between the operation weight and the
  impacts of the machinery. Also, machinery with similar operation weight had relatively
  similar impact patterns due to similar driving factors and dependencies. In addition,
  network, sensitivity, and uncertainty analyses were performed to quantify the source
  of impacts and validate the robustness of the study. Results of the sensitivity
  analysis showed that the responsiveness of the studied systems is very sensitive
  to changes in the amount of fuel consumption. In addition, the uncertainty results
  showed that the domain of uncertainty increased as the operation weight subcategory
  of machinery increased. Conclusion: This study extends previous work on the life
  cycle assessment (LCA) of construction machinery, and the methodology developed
  provides a basis for future extension and improvement in this field. The use of
  effective hours as the unit of operational efficiency helps to resolve uncertainties
  linked to lifetime and annual operation hours. Also, the obtained results can be
  of use for decision support and for assessing the impacts of transition from fossil
  fuels to alternative fuel types.  '
