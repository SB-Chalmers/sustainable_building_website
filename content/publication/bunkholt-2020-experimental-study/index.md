abstract: 'Pitched wooden roofs are ventilated through an air cavity beneath the roofing
  in order to remove heat and moisture from the roof construction. The ventilation
  is driven by wind pressure and thermal buoyancy. This paper studies ventilation
  driven by thermal buoyancy in the air cavity of inclined roofs. The influence of
  air cavity design and roof inclination on the airflow is investigated. Laboratory
  measurements were carried out on an inclined full-scale roof model with an air cavity
  heated on one side in order to simulate solar radiation on a roof surface. Equipment
  to measure temperature was installed in the roof model, while air velocity in the
  cavity was determined by smoke tests. Combinations of different roof inclinations,
  air cavity heights and applied heating power on the air cavity top surface were
  examined. The study showed that increased air cavity height led to increased airflow
  and decreased surface temperatures in the air cavity. Increased roof inclination
  and heating power applied to the roofing also increased the airflow. The investigations
  imply that thermal buoyancy in the air cavity of pitched roofs could be a relevant
  driving force for cavity ventilation and important to consider when evaluating the
  heat and moisture performance of such a construction.  '
