abstract: To accomplish the sustainability potential of the sharing economy
  (SE), there is a need for proactive governance of the SE. In this paper, we
  aim to generate knowledge on household product consumption and sharing to
  support SE governance in Gothenburg City (Sweden). Data from two independent
  cross-sectional questionnaire surveys were statistically analyzed, which
  generated insights within 7 product groups covering household durables; and
  within 20 demographic categories regarding gender, age, dwelling type,
  education level, family composition, and income. Results were in accordance
  with the well-known attitude-behavior gaps regarding sustainable practices,
  though variance was seen for these gaps depending on the product and
  demographic group considered. The study suggests that, for 2021, clothes were
  consumed in high amounts (units/year) but there was relatively low interest
  and participation in sharing them, while the opposite was seen for tools and
  leisure items. As for demographic groups, men were less likely than women to
  reduce their consumption through participating in sharing, contrary to
  respondents with higher education. Governance reflections are included for the
  highlighted cases, such as investigating the reasons why men are less
  interested in the SE and in reducing their consumption; and exploring hinders
  to achieving a critical mass of users and providers in clothes sharing.
