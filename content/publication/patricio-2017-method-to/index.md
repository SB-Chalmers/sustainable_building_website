abstract: 'Carbon Capture and Utilization is an attractive strategy not only due to
  its potential for CO2 emissions reduction but also because it enables the creation
  of valuable products. The development of CO2-based industrial symbiosis partnerships
  can contribute significantly towards achieving the goals of GHG emissions reduction
  on a European level by 2030, while at the same time it leads to an increased added
  value through the development of new production lines and carbon neutral products.
  The presented article focuses on identifying potential partnerships between companies
  that produce CO2 and companies that may reuse CO2 as input for their industrial
  process. A novel methodological framework is presented based on developing generic
  matrices for CO2 sources and receivers and matching the industrial units based on
  geographical and technical criteria. Moreover, the paper provides the technical
  requirements of 17 CO2 utilization technologies with relatively high technology
  readiness level, including the CO2-to-product ratio, the required purity, pressure,
  temperature and the presence of a catalyst, as well as potential synergies and additional
  requirements. The methodology has been applied to the Vastra Gotaland region in
  West Sweden and the most promising CCU symbioses have been identified. These include
  mineral carbonation (annual uptake: 59,600 tCO(2)), greenhouses (26,000 tCO(2)),
  algae production, methanol production (85,500 tCO(2)), power to gas (66,500 tCO(2)),
  pH control, lignin production, polymers synthesis and concrete curing (96,000 tCO(2)).
  If all of them could be applied, the total annual CO2 reduction would exceed 250,000
  tCO(2) per year.  '
