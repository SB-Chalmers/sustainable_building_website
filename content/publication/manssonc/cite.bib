 abstract = {This article presents a suite of data sets describing door openings of refrigerated display cabinets collected from an operational supermarket. Our goal is to provide a realistic and well-documented suite that will serve as a basis for consistent evaluation and study. Many applications ranging from modelling and optimising supermarket refrigeration systems to food safety and customer modelling depend on such data sets. We describe the data sets in the suite in detail along with the methodology used to collect them from an operational supermarket in Germany. We quantitatively analyse and characterise a total of  openings reported in the data sets. The properties that we study are opening speed, frequency, time, duration and opening angle with respect to a given weekday, time and type of refrigerator. We expect the current suite of data sets to attract interest and to become the core of a more extensive collection of data sets with time.  },
