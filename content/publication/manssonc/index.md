abstract: 'This article presents a suite of data sets describing door openings of
  refrigerated display cabinets collected from an operational supermarket. Our goal
  is to provide a realistic and well-documented suite that will serve as a basis for
  consistent evaluation and study. Many applications ranging from modelling and optimising
  supermarket refrigeration systems to food safety and customer modelling depend on
  such data sets. We describe the data sets in the suite in detail along with the
  methodology used to collect them from an operational supermarket in Germany. We
  quantitatively analyse and characterise a total of  openings reported in the data
  sets. The properties that we study are opening speed, frequency, time, duration
  and opening angle with respect to a given weekday, time and type of refrigerator.
  We expect the current suite of data sets to attract interest and to become the core
  of a more extensive collection of data sets with time.  '
