abstract: "Energy services provided by energy suppliers have been identified as important\
  \ in supporting sustainable development. However, the energy suppliers struggle\
  \ in developing services that support the end-users energy efficiency, due to e.g.\
  \ limited customer engagement and competition from actors with expertise in e.g.\
  \ data analytics. The purpose of this paper is to investigate challenges faced by\
  \ energy suppliers when developing services aimed at improving the end-users' energy\
  \ efficiency. A single case-study identifies challenges for energy service development\
  \ that relate to capabilities and organisation, respectively.  "
