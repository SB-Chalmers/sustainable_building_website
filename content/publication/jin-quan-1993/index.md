abstract: Integrated flight and propulsion control systems will require propulsion
  systems to reduce in time to accelerate engine and to improve transient performance
  for a full flight envelope operation. A multivariable model reference adaptive control
  (MRAC) scheme is proposed in this paper. Acceleration time is reduced by uptrimming
  engine pressure ratio in some operating conditions and in parts of the flight envelope
  where excess stall margin and turbine temperature margin exist. The MRAC scheme
  is obtained by using Liapunov direct method. Simulation studies are performed for
  a two-spool turbojet engine. The satisfactory transient responses are obtained at
  different operating points from idle to maximum dry power in flight envelope which
  shows good robustness for unmodelled dynamics of nonlinear engine. Simulation results
  also show the good effectiveness of reducing interaction in multivariable system
  with significant coupling. Using the Multivariable MRAC controller, the engine acceleration
  time is reduced about 16 percent in comparison with the conventional engine controller.
