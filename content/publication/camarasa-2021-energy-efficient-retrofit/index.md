abstract: 'Cross-country evidence on the adoption of energy-efficient retrofit measures
  (EERMs) in residential buildings is critical to supporting the development of national
  and pan-European policies aimed at fostering the energy performance upgrade of the
  building stock. In this light, the aim of this paper is to advance in the understanding
  of the probability of certain EERMs taking place in eight EU countries, according
  to a set of parameters, such as building typology, project types, and motivation
  behind the project. Using these parameters collected via a multi-country online
  survey, a set of discrete-choice (conditional logit) models are estimated on the
  probability of selecting a choice of any combination of 33 EERMs across the sampled
  countries. Results show that actions related to the building envelope are the most
  often-addressed across countries and single building elements or technology measures
  have a higher probability of being implemented. The modelling framework developed
  in this study contributes to the scientific community in three ways: (1) establishing
  an empirical relationship among EERMs and project (i.e., retrofit and deep retrofit),
  (2) identifying commonalities and differences across the selected countries, and
  (3) quantifying the probabilities and market shares of various EERMs.  '
