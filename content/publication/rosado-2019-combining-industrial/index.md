abstract: 'Growing urban population is putting pressure on the supply of natural resources
  leading to global environmental impacts and calling for new ways to manage urban
  development. Circular economy strategies can provide the means to both increase
  resource productivity and generate new business opportunities. Industrial symbiosis
  is one such strategy. We explore an industrial symbiosis application in this article.
  While most previous industrial symbiosis applications has been limited to eco-industrial
  parks, here we propose an adaptation of the industrial symbiosis and sustainable
  supply chain management concepts to urban areas in general. It is a way to develop
  economic clusters incorporating symbiotic links between multiple products supply
  chains. A proposed iterative facilitated industrial symbiosis method identifies
  an economic cluster focus, stakeholders, opportunities for resource exchange and
  sharing of infrastructure, as well as other important elements. The method provides
  systematic guidance for practitioners seeking ways to grow local industry and economy,
  increase resource productivity, reduce wastes, and better utilize local resources.
  Benefits of industrial symbiosis and barriers to its implementation are also identified
  in the method. The method comprises 5 phases, each illustrated on an example drawn
  from our application of the method in an urban development in Gothenburg, a city
  in Sweden.  '
