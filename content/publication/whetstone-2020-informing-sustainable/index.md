abstract: "Interventions targeted at district-level are a potentially effective way\
  \ to reduce consumption-based urban impacts; however, a systematic method for accounting\
  \ these impacts at district scale has not yet been developed. This article outlines\
  \ a method for transforming household expenditure data into consumption quantified\
  \ on a physical basis. Data sources are combined to calculate monetary value per\
  \ unit mass for different products consumed by households. Socio-economic household\
  \ archetypes are selected, and typical consumption for these archetypes is calculated\
  \ by combining expenditure data from a household budget survey with the calculated\
  \ monetary values per unit mass. The resulting physical quantities of different\
  \ products consumed are envisaged as an essential part of performing district scale\
  \ material flow analysis and urban metabolism studies, also as an input for assessing\
  \ consumption-based environmental impacts and for designing sustainable consumption\
  \ policies. The method was applied to characterise consumption in urban districts.\
  \ The obtained results were used to assess of districts' consumption-based impacts\
  \ with life cycle assessment (LCA) and to inform design of sharing economy. The\
  \ method was found to be an effective way to evaluate the demand for products in\
  \ different districts; this in turn could inform objective measures to aid more\
  \ sustainable urban consumption.  "
