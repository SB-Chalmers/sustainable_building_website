abstract: 'This paper presents and discusses a methodology for modeling energy and
  resource use ofurban building stocks. The methodology integrates and further develops
  methodologies for energy,carbon and resource use analysis on building stocks with
  the aim of applying these to a case study ofthe City of Gothenburg, Sweden. Integrating
  geographical information systems (GIS) in themethodology for modeling of the building
  stock, allows assessment of the contribution and effect ofvarious strategies to
  meet environmental goals for municipalities, portfolio owners, such as housingassociations
  and institutional investors. The methodology identifies different development strategiesincluding
  various options for refurbishment, add-on and new construction, which are evaluated
  withrespect to their potential environmental impacts related to the life-cycle of
  the building, includingconstruction and end-of-life options.  '
