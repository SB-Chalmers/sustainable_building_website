 abstract = {This paper presents and discusses a methodology for modeling energy and resource use ofurban building stocks. The methodology integrates and further develops methodologies for energy,carbon and resource use analysis on building stocks with the aim of applying these to a case study ofthe City of Gothenburg, Sweden. Integrating geographical information systems (GIS) in themethodology for modeling of the building stock, allows assessment of the contribution and effect ofvarious strategies to meet environmental goals for municipalities, portfolio owners, such as housingassociations and institutional investors. The methodology identifies different development strategiesincluding various options for refurbishment, add-on and new construction, which are evaluated withrespect to their potential environmental impacts related to the life-cycle of the building, includingconstruction and end-of-life options.  },
