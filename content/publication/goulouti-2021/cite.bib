 abstract = {This article presents the descriptive statistics of service life data of building elements, gathered through an international, European and Swiss literature review of LCA, LCC and other sources called “Real-Estate Management sources” that include building owners, banks, insurances, associations of tenants and owners, etc. Furthermore, the properties of the fitted lognormal distribution are given. The data are structured, using a hybrid decomposition (functional decomposition, according to the eBKP-H – SN506511 and material decomposition, as well). These data and the derived statistical distributions were used in a research study, in order to quantify the uncertainty and sensitivity of the LCA and LCC output, due to the variability of the building elements' service lives.},
