abstract: This article presents the descriptive statistics of service life data of
  building elements, gathered through an international, European and Swiss literature
  review of LCA, LCC and other sources called “Real-Estate Management sources” that
  include building owners, banks, insurances, associations of tenants and owners,
  etc. Furthermore, the properties of the fitted lognormal distribution are given.
  The data are structured, using a hybrid decomposition (functional decomposition,
  according to the eBKP-H – SN506511 and material decomposition, as well). These data
  and the derived statistical distributions were used in a research study, in order
  to quantify the uncertainty and sensitivity of the LCA and LCC output, due to the
  variability of the building elements' service lives.
