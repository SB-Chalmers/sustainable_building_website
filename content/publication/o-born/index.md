abstract: "Effective and efficient road transportation in Norway is a continuing concern.\
  \ The growth in population and the continuing need for better infrastructure to\
  \ serve this population propel the growth of road construction. Roads will continue\
  \ to occupy the most prominent place in the Norwegian transport puzzle as the most\
  \ commonly used form of transport by both people and goods today. The quadrennial\
  \ National Transport Plan guides large scale transport planning in Norway and has\
  \ recently included national CO2 emissions reductions targets for all new road infrastructure\
  \ and construction. At the same time, the investment in Norwegian road infrastructure\
  \ is at an all-time high, as authorities seek to modernize the Norwegian road network\
  \ through megaprojects, such as the Ferry Free E39. This increase in investment\
  \ and construction will inevitably lead to an increase in resource consumption and\
  \ emissions without wise planning decisions, smart material choices and the use\
  \ of sustainability assessment tools. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is one such tool\
  \ that is used to measure environmental impacts of infrastructure and construction\
  \ processes, including climate change emissions. To what extent LCA is already used\
  \ in Norwegian road planning and what lessons can be learned from earlier studies\
  \ that can apply to today's megaprojects are of interest to road builders if emissions\
  \ reduction goals are to be taken seriously. The purpose of this paper is to determine\
  \ the state-of-the-art of Norwegian road LCA and determine in which direction Norwegian\
  \ research should move. The first section of the paper looks at the overarching\
  \ conditions for Norwegian road construction in terms of planning, trends, and policy;\
  \ the second section looks at relevant LCA studies on Norwegian roads, while the\
  \ third section looks at possible research paths which should be followed to better\
  \ assess and reduce the impacts of emissions in road infrastructure.  "
