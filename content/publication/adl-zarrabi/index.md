abstract: 'The possibility of integrating energy harvesting devices into the bridge/tunnel
  structures along Coastal Highway Route E39 has been investigated in a feasibility
  study by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration (NPRA). The main advantage of
  integrating energy conversion devices in a structural element is the reduction of
  costs compared to stand-alone devices. The construction could be used as a foundation,
  a mooring point and provide a dry environment for electrical devices. Easy access
  to the production site could also reduce the cost for installation, operation and
  maintenance. Two important challenges related to harvesting renewable energy by
  infrastructure elements, without concerning about the energy source, are to store
  it or feed the energy to the grid. In the second case, tailoring generation to demand
  is of critical importance. Tasks such as supply and demand management, for instance,
  peak hour management, what kind of storage should be used - electrical or thermal
  - need be solved. Furthermore, integrating energy production devices in a structure
  might cause negative environmental impacts and affect the life expectancy and maintenance
  costs of such structures. The potential environmental impacts associated with renewable
  technologies are the consequences for bird life or marine fauna at the fjord crossing
  locations, as well as noise and visual impact. Thus, a sustainability assessment
  should be performed in order to quantify the ecological, economical and societal
  impacts of the suggested alternatives.  '
