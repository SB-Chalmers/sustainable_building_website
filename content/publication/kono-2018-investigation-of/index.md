abstract: "With the increasing importance of the sustainable product development of\
  \ the building materials for the sustainable building and its industries, this study\
  \ structured the existing sustainability assessment methods based on a common information\
  \ structure, which was classified by its categories, aspects, and indicators. Sustainability\
  \ indicator lists were structured into 25 categories, 88 aspects which 25% of those\
  \ were product or product and regional related ones. Most of the sorted indicators\
  \ related to products were difficult to be applied at the early phase of product\
  \ development due to the lack of required level of information. Meanwhile, the indicators\
  \ could be a supportive tool for the later phase of product development, for the\
  \ production planning step as an example. Since the regional conditions showed the\
  \ link between the sustainability performance during the building's operational\
  \ phase, the conditions may serve as a proxy information to guide during the earlier\
  \ product development phase.  "
