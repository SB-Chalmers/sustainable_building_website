abstract: "To achieve carbon targets, the European Union (EU) aims to promote nearly\
  \ zero-energy buildings (nZEB). To enable the necessary transition, technical solutions\
  \ need to converge with socio-economic factors, such values and awareness of stakeholders\
  \ involved in the decision-making process. In this light, the aim of this paper\
  \ is to characterise perceived drivers and barriers to nine energy-efficient technologies\
  \ (EET), according to key decision-makers' and persuaders of the technology selection\
  \ in the EU residential building context. Results are collected across eight EU\
  \ countries, i.e. Belgium (BE), Germany (DE), Spain (ES), France (FR), Italy (IT),\
  \ Netherlands (NL), Poland (PL), and United Kingdom (UK). The stakeholdersâ€™ selected\
  \ are architects, construction companies, engineers, installers and demand-side\
  \ actors. Data from a multi-country survey is analysed to calculate the share of\
  \ 15 drivers and 21 barriers (aggregated to 5 groups), being selected for each EET\
  \ and country. The 5 groups considered to analyse drivers and barriers are environmental,\
  \ technical, economic, social, legal. The perceived barriers and drivers were further\
  \ studied for their association across the countries using the Pearson's Chi2 and\
  \ a Cramer's V tests. The results demonstrate that across all EETs and countries,\
  \ the technical and economic driver groups are perceived to have the highest potential\
  \ to increase the implementation rate of EET. In terms of barriers, economic aspects\
  \ are seen as the foremost reason that EET are not scaling faster. In both drivers\
  \ and barriers legal aspects are the least often selected. In overall the barrier\
  \ groups show significant variation across countries compared to driver groups.\
  \ These findings provide an evidence-basis to better understand arguments in favour\
  \ and against specific EETs and, in this way, support policy makers and other interested\
  \ parties to increase the market share of the selected solutions.  "
