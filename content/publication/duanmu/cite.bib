 abstract = {Architectural design is based on the reliability and rationality of construction standards. The thermal comfort standard is a very important part of construction standards. In this study, Chinese researches about the field survey of various areas were summarized. The distribution range of thermal comfo rt temperature and neutral temperature were obtained by using the PMV evaluation index. The neutral temperature of different types of buildings in different seasons was summarized. Its relationship with indoor parameters was analyzed in detail. These findings provide a basis for the formulation of building specifications and architectural design in future.  },
