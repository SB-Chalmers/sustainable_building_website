abstract: 'Energy services provided by energy suppliers have been identified as important
  in supporting sustainable development. However, the energy suppliers struggle in
  developing services that support the end-users energy efficiency, due to e.g. limited
  customer engagement and competition from actors with expertise in e.g. data analytics.
  The purpose of this paper is to investigate challenges faced by energy suppliers
  when developing services aimed at improving the end-users’ energy efficiency. A
  single case-study identifies challenges for energy service development that relate
  to capabilities and organisation, respectively.  '
