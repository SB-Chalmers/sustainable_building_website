abstract: 'The objective of this subtask I is to present the main characteristic of
  SIM (Super Insulating Materials) compared to traditional materials. Two main SIM
  are considered: - VIP (Vacuum Insulation Panel) - APM (Advanced Porous Materials).
  Moreover, the present report provides an up-to-date catalogue of commercially available
  materials & components with technical description and data of each product and information
  about the application domains and the implementation rules. An overview on all the
  application areas such as external & internal wall insulation, roofs, floors, ceilings
  łdotsare investigated through a few case studies. Finally, preliminary results about
  Life Cycle Assessment of SIM are presented at the end of the report.  '
