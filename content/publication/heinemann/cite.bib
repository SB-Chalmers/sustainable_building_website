 abstract = {The objective of this subtask I is to present the main characteristic of SIM (Super Insulating Materials) compared to traditional materials. Two main SIM are considered: - VIP (Vacuum Insulation Panel) - APM (Advanced Porous Materials). Moreover, the present report provides an up-to-date catalogue of commercially available materials & components with technical description and data of each product and information about the application domains and the implementation rules. An overview on all the application areas such as external & internal wall insulation, roofs, floors, ceilings łdotsare investigated through a few case studies. Finally, preliminary results about Life Cycle Assessment of SIM are presented at the end of the report.  },
