abstract: 'In this article, a new method based on Material Flow Accounting is proposed
  to study detailed material flows in battery consumption that can be replicated for
  other countries. The method uses regularly available statistics on import, industrial
  production and export of batteries and battery-containing electric and electronic
  equipment (EEE). To promote method use by other scholars with no access to such
  data, several empirically results and their trends over time, for different types
  of batteries occurrence among the EEE types are provided. The information provided
  by the method can be used to: identify drivers of battery consumption; study the
  dynamic behavior of battery flows - due to technology development, policies, consumers
  behavior and infrastructures. The method is exemplified by the study of battery
  flows in Sweden for years 1996-2013. The batteries were accounted, both in units
  and weight, as primary and secondary batteries; loose and integrated; by electrochemical
  composition and share of battery use between different types of EEE. Results show
  that, despite a fivefold increase in the consumption of rechargeable batteries,
  they account for only about 14% of total use of portable batteries. Recent increase
  in digital convergence has resulted in a sharp decline in the consumption of primary
  batteries, which has now stabilized at a fairly low level. Conversely, the consumption
  of integrated batteries has increased sharply. In 2013, 61% of the total weight
  of batteries sold in Sweden was collected, and for the particular case of alkaline
  manganese dioxide batteries, the value achieved 74%. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All
