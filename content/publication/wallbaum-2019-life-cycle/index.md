abstract: 'By definition, life cycle management (LCM) is a framework “of concepts,
  techniques, and procedures to address environmental, economic, technological, and
  social aspects of products and organizations in order to achieve continuous ‘sustainable’
  improvement from a life cycle perspective” (Hunkeler et al. 2001). Thus, LCM theoretically
  integrates all sustainability dimensions, and strives to provide a holistic perspective.
  It also assists in the efficient and effective use of constrained natural and financial
  resources to reduce negative impacts on society (Sonnemann and Leeuw 2006; Adibi
  et al. 2015). The LCM of infrastructures is the adaptation of product life cycle
  management (PLM) as techniques to the design, construction, and management of infrastructures.
  Infrastructure life cycle management requires accurate and extensive information
  that might be generated through different kinds of intelligent and connected information
  workflows, such as building information modeling (BIM).  '
