abstract: A survey of several workflows for the optimization of various objectives
  involved in the design of buildings using parametric design tools are presented.
  A greater emphasis is placed on workflows targeted towards the structural optimization
  of the building. A general design optimization workflow is identified, and a new
  consolidated workflow is presented. Further, an overview of the tools and methods
  implemented in each of the steps is presented in order to encourage more designers
  to explore the utility of combining opensource tools in their parametric design
  workflow. It is also found that no singular tool, method or approach is objectively
  superior. Rather, the selections of these tools, methods and approaches must take
  into consideration the specific needs of the problem, feasibility of acquiring the
  tool, the capabilities of the tools and user preferences, extent of collaboration
  as well as the required level of accuracy the project requires. Copyright Â© 2019
