 abstract = {A survey of several workflows for the optimization of various objectives involved in the design of buildings using parametric design tools are presented. A greater emphasis is placed on workflows targeted towards the structural optimization of the building. A general design optimization workflow is identified, and a new consolidated workflow is presented. Further, an overview of the tools and methods implemented in each of the steps is presented in order to encourage more designers to explore the utility of combining opensource tools in their parametric design workflow. It is also found that no singular tool, method or approach is objectively superior. Rather, the selections of these tools, methods and approaches must take into consideration the specific needs of the problem, feasibility of acquiring the tool, the capabilities of the tools and user preferences, extent of collaboration as well as the required level of accuracy the project requires.
