abstract: 'This paper introduces a new method to account for the stocks and flows
  of road infrastructure at the national level based on material flow accounting (MFA).
  The proposed method closes some of the current shortcomings in road infrastructures
  that were identified through MFA: (1) the insufficient implementation of prospective
  analysis, (2) heavy use of archetypes as a way to represent road infrastructure,
  (3) inadequate attention to the inclusion of dissipative flows, and (4) limited
  coverage of the uncertainties. The proposed dynamic bottom-up MFA method was tested
  on the Norwegian road network to estimate and predict the material stocks and flows
  between 1980 and 2050. Here, a supervised machine learning model was introduced
  to estimate the road infrastructure instead of archetypical mapping of different
  roads. The dissipation of materials from the road infrastructure based on tire-pavement
  interaction was incorporated. Moreover, this study utilizes iterative classified
  and regression trees, lifetime distributions, randomized material intensities, and
  sensitivity analyses to quantify the uncertainties.  '
