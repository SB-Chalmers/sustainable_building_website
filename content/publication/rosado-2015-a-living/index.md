abstract: 'The greater proportion of global emission production and resource consumption
  takes place in cities. Innovations are needed to reduce the use of resources and
  emissions within the building sector, but the sector is slow to innovate and integrate
  new technology, and high-impact city-scale interventions are difficult, owing to
  the complexity of factors. In this paper, a district-scale approach is projected
  to be an effective way to invoke change within the built environment of a city system,
  exemplified through the European Union-funded Climate-KIC Smart Sustainable Districts
  (SSD) Flagship Project in Gothenburg, Sweden. The SSD aims to reach Factor 10 reductions
  in the use of resources within the Johanneberg District. A co-creation environment
  is proposed to incorporate technology innovation for sustainable living into the
  district, and ultimately city, level, which will be realised through the HSB Living
  Lab Project, a living lab infrastructure under construction on the campus of Chalmers
  University of Technology. Interventions to reduce the use of resources at a district-scale
  systems level in combination with real-world testing and creation of innovative
  technology within living lab environments have high potential to effect a reduction
  in city system resource consumption and emissions. This pilot stage proposition
  will be tested through the implementation of both SSD and HSB Living Lab projects.  '
