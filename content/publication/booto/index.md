abstract: 'This paper reveals the main factors that guide road alignment design process
  in Norway. The goal is to discover what constitutes the main priorities for road
  planners, how these priorities are ranked when it comes to alignment selection,
  and how they are related to guiding factors identified in official planning documents
  and government transport plans throughout the life cycle of a road. This is done
  through a comprehensive literature and data search, involving published academic
  research in the road alignment design field, and by exploring Norwegian road planning
  documents and guidelines. Examples from a recently implemented road project are
  also included as a way to illustrate alignment priorities in theory versus how alignment
  decisions are made in practice. Particular attention is paid to how key factors
  influence environmental and social dimensions and how much importance these dimensions
  are given in the overall decision-making process. The focus on the Norwegian case
  is relevant in that it will identify which knowledge gaps need to be filled based
  on actual practices in the Norwegian road sector. The results of this study found
  that the dominating factors in road planning and alignment selection are the user
  cost and the environmental and socio-economic as they are directly related to the
  main national transport strategy of developing a carbon-neutral and resilient transport
  system. These results can be used to reinforce and amplify existing road planning
  strategies and to understand where challenges for environmental and social responsible
  road planning and alignment selection are found.  '
