 abstract = {This study investigates previous refurbishment activities linked to spatial distribution of individual buildings. The work identifies where larger changes has been made (or not), to what extent and in relation to type of ownership. A specific aim is to test selected parameters from the Swedish Property register to analyze refurbishments using the multi-family resi-dential building stock of the city of Gothenburg, 7172 buildings, as an example. The stock has been divided into six age-classes: before 1931, 1931-1945, 1946-1960, 1961-1975, 1976-1990, and 1991-2005. Extensive refurbishment activities were carried out in the stock constructed before 1946. Almost half of the stock has not been refurbished to a larger ex-tent. There is no clear relation between type of ownership and larger re-furbishments for the total stock, however the tenant owned stock is less refurbished for the periods covering 1931-1975. The property register is a valuable source for studying major refurbishment activities in lager stocks. Further studies are needed to obtain a more nuanced picture of the refurbishment activities.  },
