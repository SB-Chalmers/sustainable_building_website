abstract: 'Environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) witnesses increasing popularity
  in the built environment. LCA stimulates among others an efficient use of natural
  resources and a reduction of carbon emissions through quantification of material
  and energy inputs and emissions in the building life cycle. Thereby, LCA aspires
  to contribute to SDG12 on ensuring sustainable consumption and production patterns.
  Despite high ambitions, the actual influence of LCA in construction projects is
  often modest. The mere application of LCA methodology in a building project is insufficient
  to produce a more environmentally friendly building. To better understand the practical
  conditions under which an LCA may induce change in a building project, we propose
  to analyse the use of LCA from a processual perspective. This paper presents a case
  study of a building product development project in which a processual perspective
  is applied on LCA. Using a longitudinal ethnographic methodology, key actors are
  followed through environmentally relevant episodes as the building project matures.
  A progressive LCA quantifies the potential environmental impact of the project as
  it progresses through different stages of the building process. Based on the learnings
  from this study, recommendations are presented to support the effective use of LCA
  in sustainable building practices, and contribute to SDG12 on sustainable consumption
  and production patterns.  '
