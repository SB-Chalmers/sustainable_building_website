abstract: 'The building construction industry is in need of sustainable materials
  and solutions. A novel building material, such as Textile Reinforced Concrete (TRC),
  could be used to meet this demand. TRC is a combination of fine-grained concrete
  and multi-axial textile fabrics, which has been fundamentally researched over the
  past decade. It was discovered that TRC can be utilized to build slender, lightweight,
  modular and freeform structures while eliminating the risk of corrosion. TRC-based
  research has explored various facets of this composite material, such as its structural
  functionality, production, applicability and design. One key aspect that is still
  missing, however, is a comprehensive review of the sustainable potential of this
  material in terms of its reduced use of resources and long-term performance.This
  article provides a quantitative evaluation of the sustainable potential and prospective
  development of TRC particularly reinforced by alkali-resistant (AR) glass, carbon
  or basalt fibres. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was performed according to a cradle-to-gate
  perspective, wherein conventional steel reinforced concrete and TRC were compared.Based
  on the outcome of this evaluation, concrete was found to be the dominating variable,
  such that its demand makes up 80-95% of the total energy demand for a reinforced
  concrete element. A decrease in concrete can thus have a substantial impact on the
  total energy consumption of a reinforced concrete element. The allowable decrease
  of concrete in TRC compensates for an increase in textile reinforcement and associated
  increase in energy consumption, particularly in the case of carbon and basalt textile
  fibres. On the whole, basalt textile fibres were observed to have the least cumulative
  energy demand while both basalt and carbon had the least environmental impact. Such
  comprehensive evaluations can help conceptualize ecologically sustainable building
  solutions for implementation in the construction industry.  '
