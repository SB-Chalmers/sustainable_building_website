abstract: 'This article sets the scene for the special issue of Cities & Health Journal
  on ‘Transforming cities and health: policy, innovation and practice.’ It focuses
  on systematic transformations to meet sustainability and climate goals whilst also
  placing health at the heart of policy change and action. Our intention is to raise
  broad issues drawing on multiple disciplines and provoke engagement with this area
  of underachievement. We ask: ● How do we achieve action and momentum in transformational
  change? ● What are the key components for future transformations in terms of governance,
  business models, time and sequencing, scaling, leadership and imagination? ● Are
  there limits and barriers to what can be achieved? ● Do these demands require a
  more radical and fundamental change and strategic direction? In responding we note
  the policy-action gap and the failure to recognise the complexity in policy responses,
  the continuing growth of cities and the ongoing inability to address basic health
  needs, and we speculate about the changes that affect the context in which we work
  over the next decade. We highlight two case studies, where we are involved, that
  attempt to close the implementation gap and progress transformations. We then offer
  some further reflections in relation to research and practice in attempting to transform
  cities and health together to meet the Paris Agreement on climate change, the implementation
  of the UN SDGs and actions on biodiversity. In discussion, we return to the current
  pandemic and what this tells us about this moment, future transformations and the
  possibilities and limits to action.  '
