abstract: 'A large share of construction material stock (MS) accumulates in urban
  built environments. To attain a more sustainable use of resources, knowledge about
  the spatial distribution of urban MS is needed. In this article, an innovative spatial
  analysis approach to urbanMS is proposed. Within this scope, MSindicators are defined
  at neighborhood level and clusteredwith k-mean algorithms. The MS is estimated bottom-up
  with (a) material-intensity coefficients and (b) spatial data for three built environment
  components: buildings, road transportation, and pipes, using sevenmaterial categories.
  The city of Gothenburg, Sweden is used as a case study. Moreover, being the first
  case study in Northern Europe, the results are explored through various aspects
  (material composition, age distribution, material density), and, finally, contrasted
  on a per capita basis with other studies worldwide. The stock is estimated at circa
  84 million metric tons. Buildings account for 73% of the stock, road transport 26%,
  and pipes 1%. Mineral-binding materials take the largest share of the stock, followed
  by aggregates, brick, asphalt, steel, and wood. Per capita, the MS is estimated
  at 153 metric tons; 62 metric tons are residential, which, in an international context,
  is a medium estimate. Denser neighborhoodswith a mix of nonresidential and residential
  buildings have a lower proportion of MS in roads and pipes than low-density single-family
  residential neighborhoods. Furthermore, single-family residential neighborhoods
  cluster in mixed-age classes and show the largest content of wood. Multifamily buildings
  cluster in three distinct age classes, and each represent a specific material composition
  of brick, mineral binding, and steel. Future work should focus on megacities and
  contrasting multiple urban areas and, methodologically, should concentrate on algorithms,MS
  indicators, and spatial divisions of urban stock.  '
