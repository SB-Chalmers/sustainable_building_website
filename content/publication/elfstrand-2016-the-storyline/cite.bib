 abstract = {© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.The storyline for the design of a Living Lab is presented from the idea stage through to building construction. The design process was a co-production of social and technical knowledge within the emerging partnership, which was structured around six defined focus fields. It also describes how a unique participation within Chalmers, focused on linking research in space, added to the inspiration. The outcome is that once built, HSB Living Lab is both an innovative building and a real-life user-centered facility with the flexibility to enhance and enable innovation through the lifetime of the building.  },
