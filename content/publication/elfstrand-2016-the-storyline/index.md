abstract: '© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.The storyline for
  the design of a Living Lab is presented from the idea stage through to building
  construction. The design process was a co-production of social and technical knowledge
  within the emerging partnership, which was structured around six defined focus fields.
  It also describes how a unique participation within Chalmers, focused on linking
  research in space, added to the inspiration. The outcome is that once built, HSB
  Living Lab is both an innovative building and a real-life user-centered facility
  with the flexibility to enhance and enable innovation through the lifetime of the
  building.  '
