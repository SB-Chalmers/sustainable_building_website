abstract: Male rats were fed diets containing 0.5% cholesterol with or without vegetable
  (water convolvulus) or neutral detergent fiber supplementation. After 2 weeks, rats
  were given [4-14C]cholesterol i.p. Feces were collected for 1 week. Three hours
  prior to necropsy, [3H]acetate was administered i.p. Samples of serum, liver, adipose
  tissue, muscle and brain were obtained for analysis. Concentrations of total lipids
  and cholesterol and synthesis and recovery of labeled steroids are reported. Results
  showed that the growth of animals and food utilization were not significantly affected
  by different dietary treatments. The notable effect of vegetable was that the elevated
  liver and serum cholesterol levels due to increased intake can be nearly offset
  by increasing the fecal excretion. The high rate of excretion of 14C-labeled steroids
  shown in vegetable-fed rats indicated that both decreased absorption and increased
  endogenous excretion occurred in these animals. The synthesis of total lipids as
  demonstrated by [3H]acetate incorporation was not affected appreciably by diet.
  In liver, however, cholesterol synthesis appeared to be lower in rats receiving
  cholesterol-supplemented diet, but higher in rats fed vegetable diets. The ratio
  of 3H:14C of liver cholesterol was significantly higher in rats fed the vegetable
  diet. In brain cholesterol we also found consistently high 3H:14C ratios, which
  were not affected by dietary intake. It appears that brain cholesterol level is
  maintained mainly by synthesis in situ and not by uptake from dietary or other sources.
