abstract: 'Urban building-stocks must be transformed in order to reduce energy and
  resource use to achieve climate change mitigation targets. As the rate of renewal
  in the building-stock is low, energy efficiency measures need to be applied when
  renovation is being done. In order to evaluate renovation potential of the existing
  building stock on an urban level, a local approach is needed to understand challenges
  and possibilities associated with the transformation of the building-stock. By incorporating
  building-specific information and also considering the building in its setting,
  a more holistic view can be achieved. For this purpose, available databases containing
  building-specific information has been gathered and processed for the multi-family
  building stock of the city of Gothenburg. The available data is used to describe
  the energy performance of the stock, future renovation needs and is used to create
  a description of the stock used as input for calculating the energy demand. This
  thesis with appended papers shows that available data sources can be used to describe
  the characteristics of the stock on a building level while considering the location
  and context. Building attributes such as year of construction, value year, property
  owner, geometric data and energy performance certificates is spatially linked as
  well as used in modelling the energy performance of buildings to provide detailed
  and valuable information to policy makers, urban planners and property owners.  '
