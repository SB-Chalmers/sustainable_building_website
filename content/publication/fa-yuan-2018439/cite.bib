 abstract = {In order to know the audible noise characters of transmission line and its influence on nearby residents'lives, the measurement and extraction method based on the singular value decomposition technology was presented. The results show that the sound pressure level obtained by Fourier transform is larger than that obtained by singular value decomposition; the sound pressure level and spectrum of field noise are different between day and night, which is mainly due to the interference of background noise such as beetle and frog calls in the course of night testing; and the noise level is extracted by. The obtained acoustic level and spectral characteristics of the audible noise are basically close to each other, which indicates that the technology of extracting the audible noise of transmission lines in this study can effectively filter out the interference of random noise signals.
