abstract: In order to know the audible noise characters of transmission line and its
  influence on nearby residents'lives, the measurement and extraction method based
  on the singular value decomposition technology was presented. The results show that
  the sound pressure level obtained by Fourier transform is larger than that obtained
  by singular value decomposition; the sound pressure level and spectrum of field
  noise are different between day and night, which is mainly due to the interference
  of background noise such as beetle and frog calls in the course of night testing;
  and the noise level is extracted by. The obtained acoustic level and spectral characteristics
  of the audible noise are basically close to each other, which indicates that the
  technology of extracting the audible noise of transmission lines in this study can
  effectively filter out the interference of random noise signals. Â© 2018 IEEE.
