abstract: A top-down method for identifying product inputs to industries at product
  level is presented. The method employs routinely reported statistical data for industries,
  namely international trade data, which enables simple data acquisition and updates
  to databases with changes in the production processes. Two databases were developed
  that contain information for 103 industries and 1,264 product types based on a 13-year
  data time series. The first database shows frequency for a given product import
  by an industry; the second database shows the relative magnitude of product demand
  compared to the total amount of products imported by the industry. The frequency
  database depicts stability of a given product demand while the magnitude database
  identifies core products. The study was performed for Swedish imports. An upscaling
  evaluation was tested with Swedish exports and Portuguese imports data sets. It
  was found that industries have similar frequency of product demand, regardless of
  the country they are located in. Import magnitudes were found to have more dependence
  on the country for which data was collected. Nevertheless, when aggregated into
  major products groups, industrial product consumption is very similar in the two
  countries studied. One possible application of the databases developed in this study
  could be identification of new opportunities for industrial symbiosis among all
  industries operating in a region. Collated raw material inputs by industry are available
  in the databases, allowing industries which could potentially receive byproducts
  and wastes from elsewhere to be determined, without the need for direct contact
  between different actors.
