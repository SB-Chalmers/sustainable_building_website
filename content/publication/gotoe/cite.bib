 abstract = {A vapor-open wooden building envelope for subtropical regions and its design optimization method, whichconsiders environmental, economic and thermo-hygric aspects, were developed by the authors. As a case study, a test house(a detached residential building) has been constructed in Ohmihachiman (central Japan) and a number oftemperature/humidity sensors were installed inside the walls as well as in the rooms. It was found that closecommunications among the designers, the constructors and the client is essential in order to realize a building with newfeatures as it is designed. The hygrothermal model of the building envelope was successfully validated.  },
