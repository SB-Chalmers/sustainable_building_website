abstract: 'A vapor-open wooden building envelope for subtropical regions and its design
  optimization method, whichconsiders environmental, economic and thermo-hygric aspects,
  were developed by the authors. As a case study, a test house(a detached residential
  building) has been constructed in Ohmihachiman (central Japan) and a number oftemperature/humidity
  sensors were installed inside the walls as well as in the rooms. It was found that
  closecommunications among the designers, the constructors and the client is essential
  in order to realize a building with newfeatures as it is designed. The hygrothermal
  model of the building envelope was successfully validated.  '
