abstract: 'The increased use of BIM in the building sector have led certain actors
  to commence riding on the big data hype. Big data techniques allow the use of unstructured
  data alongside structured data to an extent that was previously impossible. Science
  and technology studies (STS) approaches are used to examine information standards
  as a technology to organise big data applications in building. Crucially, opportunities
  are strongly guided by the data that is collected about buildings, and thus by the
  understanding of what a building is. Building information standards are viewed as
  performative and their becoming as a process of power, understanding and emerging
  interests. The empirical material stems from a study on the shaping of a Danish
  classification standard and its implementation in a Danish hospital project. The
  analysis shows several performative aspects and particular ways in which a building
  can be understood: First, there is a focus on the internal structure of a building
  as a product and less on the process that leads to making a product. Second, a systems
  theory approach to building structure understands building components as having
  functions in a way that aligns well with the installation part of the building.
  Third, delimitations within which information standards propose to collect data
  implies a focus on building components as material over components being economical
  entities. Performativity struggles during the shaping of the standard are expected
  to continue also during its implementation phase in an environment where multiple
  standards co-exist. On this background we discuss whether the building information
  standard, meant to be a big data technology enabler, might become a barrier for
  big data.  '
