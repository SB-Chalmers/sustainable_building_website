 abstract = {A study of energy levels in V and Cr doped VPE GaAs was performed using infrared photoconductivity and photo-induced transient spectroscopy (PITS). SIMS analysis was performed on the epilayer and the substrate. V and Cr coexisted in the epilayer whereas only Cr was contained in the substrate. PITS measurements were made on the epilayer and three peaks of 0. 15 ev, 0. 43 ev and 0. 72 ev were obtained.},
