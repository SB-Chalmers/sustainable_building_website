abstract: A study of energy levels in V and Cr doped VPE GaAs was performed using
  infrared photoconductivity and photo-induced transient spectroscopy (PITS). SIMS
  analysis was performed on the epilayer and the substrate. V and Cr coexisted in
  the epilayer whereas only Cr was contained in the substrate. PITS measurements were
  made on the epilayer and three peaks of 0. 15 ev, 0. 43 ev and 0. 72 ev were obtained.
