 abstract = {In this paper, the process of preparation of Ga1-xAlxAs/GaAs solar cell is reported and the factors which effect change in performance are also uncovered. The highest coversion efficiency of these solar cell has achieved 19.0% (AM1, 2 Ã— 2 cm2). The error of standardization in space is +0.24%.},
