  This report analyses the stakeholders’ practices and needs related to circular
  economy in the construction sector. It focuses on the three living labs of the
  CREATE project: Rennes Métropole (France), Nijmegen (Netherlands) and
  Gothenburg (Sweden). 

  Analysis is based on three complementary investigation methods: a review of literature, an online questionnaire and interviews with key actors.

  The study shows that the municipalities are already implementing ambitious and innovative policies for the circular economy in construction. Particularly, environmental assessments of construction projects based on a life cycle approach become “standard”, often in response to national legislations. However, the study of material flows and associated environmental impacts at the level of the urban project or the city is still underdeveloped.

  These observations open interesting perspectives for the CREATE project. They confirm the interest of better producing and sharing data on material stocks and flows at an urban scale (project or territory) as a decision support.
