abstract: 'The article entitled ‘Review: the availability of life-cycle studies in
  Sweden’ by Croft and colleagues (January 2019, volume 24, issue 1, pages 6–11) has
  puzzled many researchers in Sweden. The stated purpose of the article is to review
  the availability of water and carbon footprinting studies and life-cycle assessment
  (LCA) studies in Sweden. Despite its title and purpose suggesting otherwise, the
  article appears to be about the accessibility of life-cycle case studies from Sweden
  in South Africa. It is problematic that the article claims to be a review in the
  title and text, but is presented by the journal as a commentary. We believe that
  the article’s method is unclear and that its title and results are misleading. The
  authors of the article found only 12 academic papers, 10 academic theses, 8 company
  reports, and 1 presentation. This result significantly underestimates the actual
  production and availability of Swedish LCA case studies.  '
