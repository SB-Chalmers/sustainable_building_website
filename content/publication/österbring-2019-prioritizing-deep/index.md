abstract: 'Cost-effectiveness of deep renovation has been assessed thoroughly on a
  building level. Such studies pro- vide limited guidance when prioritizing renovation
  measures for a building portfolio. On a stock level, building-stock modelling is
  commonly used to assess impact of renovation on a national and city level, targeting
  stakeholders operating at a planning or policy level. However, due to methodological
  choices and data availability, assessment of property owner portfolios is lacking.
  The aim of this paper is to cal- culate and spatially differentiate cost-effectiveness
  of deep renovation using equivalent annual cost and increase in assessed building
  value for a portfolio owner as a first step in prioritizing deep renovation within
  a building portfolio. A bottom-up engineering-based model is applied utilizing building-specific
  information for a municipal housing company portfolio in the City of Gothenburg,
  Sweden, consisting of 1803 multi-family buildings. Energy demand for space heating
  and hot-water is calibrated using mea- sured energy use from energy performance
  certificates. Deep renovation is assessed by applying a pack- age of measures across
  all buildings. Results show average energy use reduction across the portfolio of
  51% to an average cost of 597 EUR/m 2 living area. While average energy cost savings
  account for 21% of equivalent annual cost, there are seven buildings where more
  than half the annual equivalent cost of renovation is covered by energy cost savings.
  Similarly, the distribution of change in assessed build- ing value is large for
  individual buildings, ranging from 0–23%. Aggregating results to larger areas tend
  to average out results while differences between individual buildings within areas
  persists. As such, the cost-effectiveness of deep renovation should be assessed
  on a building-by-building basis rather than for an area or neighbourhood. The results
  are intended as a first step in prioritizing deep renovation within a building portfolio
  and further detailed assessment is needed.  '
