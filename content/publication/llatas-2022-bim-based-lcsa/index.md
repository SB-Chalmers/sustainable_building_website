abstract: 'Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) is an integrated method that
  combines environmental, economic, and social assessments. Its methodological development
  remains under discussion, mainly regarding the building design. This paper aims
  to provide a systematic, interoperable, and open-source approach towards implementing
  LCSA in Building Information Modelling (BIM) in five steps. A harmonized data structure
  that enriches BIM objects is proposed. Automation in the principal evaluation step
  is provided by integrating new parameters into the current Industry Foundation Classes
  (IFC4). A Dynamo script verifies its utility in a case study in Spain using real-time
  calculations and visualizations. Two alternative structural systems are assessed,
  and identification is made of the lowest CO2 emitter, the lowest cost, and the most
  beneficial system for local employment. The approach can be employed to evaluate
  other indicators and building systems in other countries. Challenges and limitations
  in the standardization and harmonization of the three dimensions are identified.  '
