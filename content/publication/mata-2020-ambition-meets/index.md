abstract: 'A bottom-up dynamic modeling framework aiming to incorporate realities
  of the decision-making process when implementing energy-saving building renovations
  is proposed and applied to a case study of all multifamily buildings in Gothenburg,
  Sweden. The developed model is based on real conditions of existing buildings, from
  the national Energy Performance Certificate database, building and property registers,
  and cadastral maps from the city planning office. Although explorative, the framework
  accounts for the reaction capacity in terms of (i) investments by all property owners
  and (ii) total workmanship capacity in the city. Two scenarios were considered to
  account for renovations driven solely by technical renovation needs (end-of-life
  of building components) and by cost efficiency; further, both scenarios were investigated
  at different levels of reaction capacity. The developed framework is easily replicable
  to other regions and cities. The retrofitting includes, as individual measures as
  well as in packages, increased insulation levels, increased efficiency of lighting
  and appliances, and the installation of heat recovery systems and photovoltaic panels.
  Whereas implementation of energy-efficient measures dictated solely by technical
  renovation needs led to a very low energy demand, with some buildings becoming energy
  producers by 2050, implementation strictly driven by cost-efficiency (from the perspective
  of the property owners) only reduced the energy demand by 5% during this time and
  would not fully utilize the investment capacity of the property owners. Furthermore,
  the current limitations of reaction capacity for the market shares allowed for a
  reduction of the energy demand by only 15% during the same period. Workmanship capacity
  was more constraining than investment capacity and is thus identified as a local
  imperative need and suggests cobenefits related to job creation within the construction
  sector.  '
