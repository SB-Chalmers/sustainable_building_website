abstract: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is increasingly used for decision-making in
  the design process of buildings and neighbourhoods. Therefore, visualisation of
  LCA results to support interpretation and decision-making becomes more important.
  The number of building LCA tools and the published literature has increased substantially
  in recent years. Most of them include some type of visualisation. However, there
  are currently no clear guidelines and no harmonised way of presenting LCA results.
  In this paper, we review the current state of the art in visualising LCA results
  to provide a structured overview. Furthermore, we discuss recent and potential future
  developments. The review results show a great variety in visualisation options.
  By matching them with common LCA goals we provide a structured basis for future
  developments. Case studies combining different kinds of visualisations within the
  design environment, interactive dashboards, and immersive technologies, such as
  virtual reality, show a big potential for facilitating the interpretation of LCA
  results and collaborative design processes. The overview and recommendations presented
  in this paper provide a basis for future development of intuitive and design-integrated
  visualisation of LCA results to support decision-making.
