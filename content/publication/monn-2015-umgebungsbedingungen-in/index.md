abstract: 'During the research project “Quality of Sustainable Buildings” (English:
  QSB, German: QNB), twenty seven buildings were investigated. Objective measurements
  (air quality CO2, air temperature, relative humidity) were performed and in addition,
  data on subjective judgements were collected using questionnaires. The analyses
  of this paper focus on the characteristics of ventilation (natural,mechanical and
  hybrid ventilation). Mechanically ventilated buildings indicated some advantages
  during the summer period with respect to the air temperature and in the winter with
  respect to the air quality (CO2). For naturally ventilated buildings, disadvantages
  during the winter were observed with respect to the air quality (CO2). The same
  buildings showed some advantage of a higher relative humidity in the winter period
  compared with the mechanically ventilated buildings. Subjective judgements did more
  or less correspond with the measured data. However, some parameters did not. Additional
  parameters for qualifying indoor air quality (here measured as CO2 - concentration)
  need to be considered. In addition, the study showed a quite good quality (measured
  and judged) for most of the buildings. In order to contribute to energy savings
  and to achieve a better level of indoor air quality(e.g. humidity), indoor air temperature
  could be reduced in winter without negatively affecting the comfort requirements
  of the office users.  '
