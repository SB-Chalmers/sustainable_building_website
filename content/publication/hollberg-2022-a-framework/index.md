abstract: "As the high greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by the construction and\
  \ real estate sector receive more attention, more and more countries include an\
  \ environmental assessment of buildings based on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in\
  \ their building regulations. Sweden introduced mandatory climate declarations in\
  \ January 2022, for example. To support stakeholders in conducting the climate declarations\
  \ and using the results to reduce GHG emissions, user-friendly tools for early planning\
  \ stages are needed. The aim of this study is to develop and test a framework for\
  \ user centric development of such tools. The framework builds on three steps; 1)\
  \ interviewing stakeholders to define tool requirements, 2) developing a prototype\
  \ tool according to the requirements, and 3) evaluating it based on user feedback.\
  \ We developed and tested the framework in the Swedish context to provide a blueprint\
  \ applicable to other countries and contexts. The primary target users are architects\
  \ with computational design experience but also engineers and real estate developers\
  \ working in early phases. The results show that the users' expectations can be\
  \ met when the requirements are integrated from the very beginning. In the current\
  \ version, the developed building LCA tool only targets the embodied GHG emissions\
  \ from the production and construction phase of the building, but it could be extended\
  \ to include further life cycle phases in the future.  "
