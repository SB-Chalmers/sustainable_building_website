abstract: 'Purpose: Winter road maintenance in the Nordic climate is demanding due
  to challenging weather conditions, high precipitation, and icy conditions. As a
  leading country in the transition to low-emission transport, Norway must work to
  reduce their emissions while providing a safe level of service through winter maintenance
  operations. This article investigates the environmental impacts of winter road maintenance
  (WRM) in Norway both today and under a climate change scenario predicted for 2050.
  Methods: Life cycle assessment (LCA) is used to evaluate the environmental impact
  of the functional unit “average winter road maintenance in Norway on national and
  county roads per km.lane.” The ReCiPe (hierarchy) method was used to identify and
  categorize emissions related to WRM to show how different factors affect the system
  and to reveal hidden emissions hotspots. Real-time data from WRM vehicles were used
  to determine how fuel consumption is affected by gradient and weather. Producers
  and operators provided other relevant information on WRM vehicles. Official reports
  supplied information on deicer quantities used and the total distance driven by
  WRM vehicles in Norway. Results and discussion: The quantity of deicer used is the
  main source of emissions contributing toward all impact categories. The effect of
  deicer is likely to be even higher in certain impact categories. The environmental
  impact of the deicer after application is not included. The representation of WRM
  in existing emissions data is limited despite the considerable amount of deicer
  applied and the long distances that WRM vehicles travel. The results document how
  energy use throughout the system is another important source of emissions. Various
  parameters, such as road gradient, vehicle properties, driver behavior, and weather,
  affect the fuel consumption of WRM vehicles, with weather being the most important
  of these. Conclusions: Significant potential for emissions reductions from WRM was
  found, and WRM operations should be included in cold-climate road LCA studies. The
  environmental impacts of deicer application are especially high compared to the
  mechanical clearing of roads and contribute strongly to impact categories such as
  terrestrial, freshwater, and human toxicity and to the formation of particulate
  matter.  '
