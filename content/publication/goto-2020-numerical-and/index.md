abstract: 'The building industry is a major contributor of CO2 emission. Wood construction
  is a good option for carbon storage among various construction alternatives. Considering
  the growing market of multi-story wooden building in Sweden, CLT (cross laminated
  timber) structure with an alternative insulation composite with PIR insulation and
  MgO board was proposed. In order to prove the applicability of this construction
  for moisture safety, the hygrothermal performance of the wall was measured in real
  life at HSB Living Lab (Gothenburg, Sweden) throughout 2019. Furthermore, a numerical
  model to analyse its performance by transient heat and moisture transfer analysis
  was created to predict the performance of the wall system. After the successful
  validation of the numerical model, a parameter study was carried out to investigate
  the moisture risk of the wall system in the case of extensive wetting of the CLT
  panel and in various areas in Sweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm, Lund, Karlstad and
  Lule). The study showed a low mould growth risk either in the test at the living
  lab or in the feasibility study. The development of the technology should further
  focus on the cost-effectiveness and design of all the construction details for the
  future market application.  '
