abstract: '© 2019 The Authors Residential buildings account for almost a quarter of
  the total energy use in Sweden and building owners are, therefore, under pressure
  from policy makers to improve the energy performance of their buildings. Building
  portfolio owners (BPOs) generally face multiple barriers in energy efficiency investments
  such as financial constraints and lack of knowledge of the current state when planning
  energy efficiency measures. This paper presents a method for cost-optimal scheduling
  of maintenance and retrofit measures on a portfolio level by drawing on research
  on building stock modeling and maintenance retrofit planning. The method uses a
  building stock modeling approach to model costs, energy and greenhouse gas emissions
  (GHG)of a building portfolio and combines this with a method for optimal maintenance
  and retrofit scheduling in order to forecast and optimize the timing of measures
  on a building portfolio level. This enables the integrated long-term planning on
  retrofit investments and reduction of energy demand and GHG emissions for a portfolio
  of existing buildings. The application to the building portfolio of the municipal
  housing company of Gothenburg showed that by optimizing the maintenance and retrofit
  plans, ambitious retrofit measures can be introduced in the majority of the buildings
  with a positive effect on the service-life cycle costs. Moreover, the method is
  easily transferable to other building portfolios in Sweden as it builds up on nationally
  available data sets but is ideally complemented and verified using inspection data
  and existing maintenance plans of the BPOs in future applications.  '
