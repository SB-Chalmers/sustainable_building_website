abstract: With regard to the resource depletion and the global climate change, the
  construction industry is important for the realization of a sustainable society.
  In this study, a wooden envelope system for subtropical regions was investigated
  in order to find the optimal wood fiber insulation thickness. The analyses were
  done by weighting the initial investment and the running cost form the ecological
  and economic viewpoint. The building physically minimum insulation thickness was
  also calculated by hygrothermal models. It was shown that the ecological optimum
  is more costly than the economical optimum. I was also shown that the building physical
  minimum is dependent on the local climatic conditions. By conducting the analyses
  in terms of the ecology, economy and the building physics, it was able to identify
  the regions that the envelope system works more sustainably.
