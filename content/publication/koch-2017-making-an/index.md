abstract: "Digitization of buildings requires the systematic handling of a variety\
  \ and volumes of data. It is a common vision to aim for coordinated homogenization\
  \ of data structures, enabled by the classification of information. This paper studies\
  \ the role of building information standards for classification in digitization\
  \ of the building life cycle. It draws on science and technology studies of information\
  \ technology standards, big data and building information modelling (BIM) in building\
  \ research. The approach is based on performativity of standards for information\
  \ systems, viewing performativity as potentially non-linear and multiple. The five-year\
  \ design process of a large hospital in Denmark is examined as episodes of performance\
  \ of the building information standard, particularly one recent standard, the Cuneco\
  \ Classification System (CCS). The study shows that despite client demands, several\
  \ building information standards are active over time: an expansive' design brief\
  \ process adds user demands and uses room classification. Another process diminishes\
  \ the design brief more than 50%, with several standards in use. The client's facilities\
  \ management system, which performs the structuring of data backwards' into the\
  \ design process, makes architects and engineers (but not contractors) use CCS.\
  \ This fragmentation of performing standards is denoted multiple performativities'\
  \ and includes temporal and compartmental performativity.  "
