abstract: 'The use of cellulosic materials in the construction of low-rise housing
  in tropical climates has great potential. Bambusa blumeana (B. blumeana, J.A. and
  J.H. Schultes), the most abundantly available bamboo species in the Philippines,
  is a promising alternative material for the construction of cost-efficient buildings.
  However, to comply with municipal rules and regulations for construction, a comprehensive
  understanding of the organic raw material is needed to permit its application as
  a load-bearing structural member. In this study, the physical and mechanical properties
  of B. blumeana bamboo from a typical growth region of the Philippines were tested
  according to ISO 22157-1 (2004) and ISO 22157-2 (2004). The characteristic strength
  values of B. blumeana were as follows: compressive and tensile strengths parallel
  to the grain of 20 and 95 MPa, respectively; shear strength of 5 MPa, bending strength
  of 34.6 MPa, and the mean and fifth percentile modulus of elasticity of 13100 and
  8600 MPa, respectively. Based on these results, a recommendation for permissible
  stresses for structural design was made in line with ISO 22156 (2004).  '
