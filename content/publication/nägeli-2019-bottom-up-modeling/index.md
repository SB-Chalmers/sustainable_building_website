abstract: 'In Europe, residential and commercial buildings are directly and indirectly
  responsible for approximately 30–40% of the overall energy demand and emitted greenhouse
  gas (GHG) emissions. A large share of these buildings was erected before minimum
  energy-efficiency standards were implemented and are therefore not energy- or carbon-efficient.
  Consequently, buildings offer significant potential in terms of energy efficiency
  and the reduction of GHG emissions compared to the status quo. To make use of this
  potential at scale, targeted policy measures and strategies are needed that should
  be based on a quantitative assessment of the feasibility and impact of these measures.
  Building stock models (BSMs) have long been used to assess the current and future
  energy demand and GHG emissions of building stocks. Most common BSMs characterize
  the building stock through the use of archetype buildings, which are taken to be
  representative of large segments of the stock. The increasing availability of disaggregated
  datasets—such as building registries, 3D city models, and energy performance certificates—has
  given rise to building-specific BSMs focusing on describing the status quo as an
  input to energy planning, primarily on the urban scale. Owing to the availability
  of building-level data, BSMs can be extended beyond policy advice and urban planning,
  to the assessment of large building portfolios. Thus far, the advances made in building-specific
  BSMs on the urban scale have not been transferred to the national scale, where such
  datasets are often not available. Moreover, the focus on an increasingly detailed
  description of the existing stock has left approaches for modeling stock dynamics
  without much development. Stock dynamics, therefore, are still primarily modeled
  through exogenously defined retrofit, demolition, and new construction rates. This
  limits the applicability and reliability of model results, as the influence of economic,
  environmental, or policy factors on stock development is not considered. This thesis
  addresses these shortcomings and advances modeling practices in BSMs. The thesis
  with appended papers provides a methodology for how the modeling of national building
  stock can be further developed in terms of building stock characterization through
  synthetic building stocks as well as stock dynamics through the use of agent-based
  modeling. Furthermore, the thesis extends BSM applications to inform the strategic
  planning of large building portfolios through the integration of a maintenance and
  renovation scheduling method to project the future development of building portfolios.  '
