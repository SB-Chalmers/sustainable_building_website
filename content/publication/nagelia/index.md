abstract: 'European countries face a large challenge in retrofitting their aging building
  stock, which they need to embark on, in order to reach European Union (EU) energy
  and emission reduction targets. Despite significant policy interventions, refurbishment
  rates remain low and the refurbishments that are carried out often do not meet the
  energy savings targeted by the EU, for example nearly Zero-Energy Building standards
  (nZEB). One of the key reasons for the lower than expected energy savings is that
  current refurbishment approaches tend to focus predominantly on energy efficiency
  improvements for individual buildings. The integrated energy systems perspective
  that can be leveraged at a multi-building scale – and is related to possible interactions
  between building sizes, scales, and the different systems – is not taken into consideration
  in most refurbishment concepts. The result are suboptimal renovation solutions which
  do not reach the full energy demand reduction potential of the refurbished building(s).This
  paper introduces a methodology for a tool that aims to develop economically and
  environmentally optimal nZEB refurbishment concepts for multi-building scale refurbishment
  actions. Increasing the scale of a refurbishment from a single building to a multiple
  building, or even a building portfolio, will allow to generate economies of scale
  (both for solution and workforce cost) and facilitate the integration of renewable
  energy generation. The tool applies the Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) and Lifecycle
  Cost Assessment (LCC) methods, which makes it possible to optimize refurbishment
  concepts, both with respect to economic and environmental criteria. Thanks to a
  multidimensional optimization approach, based on an evolutionary algorithm that
  can automatically find the Pareto-boarder for a given design space, Pareto-optimal
  refurbishment concepts are generated. Refurbishment options presented this way can
  help housing companies prioritize refurbishment needs and actions in their building
  portfolios, as well as evaluate and select between different refurbishment approaches
  in line with overarching targets.  '
