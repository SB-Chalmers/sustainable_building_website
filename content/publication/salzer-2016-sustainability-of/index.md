abstract: 'This paper highlights the need for a more inclusive and sustainable development
  of social housing in rapidly developing countries of Asia, Latin America, and Africa.
  At the example of the Philippines, a multi-perspective development process for a
  bamboo-based building systemis developed. Sustainability Assessment Criteria are
  defined through literature review, field observations and interviews with three
  stakeholder clusters: (1) Builders and users of traditional bamboo houses in the
  Philippines; (2) Stakeholders involved in using forest products for housing in other
  countries around the world; and (3) Stakeholders in the field of social housing
  in the Philippines. Through coding and sorting of data in a qualitative content
  analysis, 15 sustainability assessment criteria are identified clustered into the
  dimensions society, ecology, economy, governance, and technology. Guided by the
  sustainability criteria and four implementation strategies: (A) Research about and
  (B) Implementation of the building technology; (C) Participation and Capacity Buildingof
  Stakeholders; and (D) Sustainable Supply Chains, a strategic roadmap was created
  naming, in total, 28 action items. Through segmentation of the complex problem into
  these action items, the paper identifies one-dimensional methods leading to measurable,
  quantitative endpoints. In this way, qualitative stakeholder data is translated
  into quantitative methods, forming a pathway for a holistic assessment of the building
  technologies. A mid-point, multi-criteria, or pareto decision-making method comparing
  the 28 endpoints of the alternative to currently practiced conventional solutions
  is suggested as subject for further research. This framework paper is a contribution
  to how sustainable building practices can become more inclusive, incorporating the
  building stock of low-income dwellers. It bridges the gap between theoretical approach
  and practical applications of sustainability and underlines the strength of combining
  multi-dimensional development with stakeholder participation.  '
