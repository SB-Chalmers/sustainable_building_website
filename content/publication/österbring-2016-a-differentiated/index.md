abstract: 'Several building-stock modelling techniques have been employed to investigate
  the impact of energy efficiency measures (EEM), where the description of the building-stock
  generally consists of an age-type classification to specify building characteristics
  for groups of buildings. Such descriptions lack the appropriate level of detail
  to differentiate the potential for EEM within age groups. This paper proposes a
  methodology for building-stock description using building-specific data and measured
  energy use to augment an age-type building-stock classification. By integrating
  building characteristics from energy performance certificates, measured energy use
  and envelope areas from a 2.5D GIS model, the building-stock description reflects
  the heterogeneity of the building-stock. The proposed method is validated using
  a local building portfolio (N = 433) in the city of Gothenburg, where modelled results
  for space heating and domestic hot water are compared to data from measurements,
  both on an individual building level and for the entire portfolio. Calculated energy
  use based on the building-stock description of the portfolio differ less than 3%
  from measured values, with 42% of the individual buildings being within a 20% margin
  of measured energy use indicating further work is needed to reduce or quantify the
  uncertainty on a building level.  '
