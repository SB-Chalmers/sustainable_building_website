abstract: "This two-wave study (time lag of six months and two years post-relocation)\
  \ investigated ways in which employees' perceptions of the office environment relate\
  \ to their perceived health in the long term, drawing on the salutogenic approach\
  \ to health and the sense of coherence theory (comprehensibility, manageability,\
  \ and meaningfulness). A mixed-method approach was adopted. The data collection\
  \ involved semi-structured interviews with employees, plus structured observations.\
  \ The findings indicate that employees found the office environment less comprehensible\
  \ and meaningful in Wave 2, while (somewhat) equally manageable. Comprehensibility\
  \ was influenced by a lack of clear behavioural rules; manageability was influenced\
  \ by a lack of control over the environment; and meaningfulness was influenced by\
  \ social environment and lack of personalization. The contextual aspects of the\
  \ office, including tasks, flexible working culture and the change processes were\
  \ critical to these findings. This study has demonstrated that negative influences\
  \ caused by poor design choices do not resolve themselves over time. When there\
  \ is limited support for one component of sense of coherence, the initial observed\
  \ benefits wear off and negative influences may spill over into other components.\
  \ Therefore, office design should be approached with balanced attention to comprehensibility,\
  \ manageability, and meaningfulness.  "
