 abstract = {While there are solid experience values for energy efficient buildings in moderate climate in Europe,the transfer of these concepts to differing climate and socio cultural conditions is a field ofexperimentation in building physics. Started as a cooperation project between Switzerland and Japanand now continued by including Sweden as a partner, the first Japanese residential building based onthe MINERGIE P® standard has recently be realized in central Japan.This presentation will offer a summary of the applied concept for the building envelope and housingservices. The focus will be on measures to deal with the high humidity loads in subtropicalindustrialized country with related demand for comfort conditions and regular earthquakes strainingthe construction and the measures to achieve the MINERGIE P® targets in Japanese climate.  },
