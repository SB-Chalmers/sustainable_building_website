abstract: 'End use energy services have an important role in the ongoing energy transition
  process by improving the value proposition to the customer through better needs
  fulfillment and experience and providing system value to the energy system. This
  study presents a framework for end use energy services, developed as a result of
  co-creation with multiple stakeholders for a case study in a living lab context.
  The framework has been co-created using the principles of systems thinking to identify
  and map both existing and emerging elements and interactions within the energy system
  and customers. The framework is organized to include aspects from energy system
  and human system perspectives and divides the energy services development process
  into three distinct stages. The development stages comprise the strategic planning
  stage, service design stage, and solution stage. Key considerations are provided
  for each stage to develop a clearer understanding of the overall end use energy
  service process.  '
