abstract: 'Decision makers are looking to reach consumption-based environmental impact
  targets like Sustainable Development Goal 12, Responsible Consumption and Production.
  These goals require multifaceted action at municipal, regional, and national levels;
  however, there are limitations to calculating consumption at the regional and municipal
  levels. Consumption is dependent on the socioeconomic metabolism of the area, with
  its unique composition of industries, consumers, and public facilities, which may
  affect the most appropriate measures to meet goals effectively. In this study, we
  evaluated several methods to extrapolate municipality- and region-specific consumption
  from national-level data so that consumption estimates can be used to aid decision
  makers or make further analyses like environmental impact evaluation. We compared
  four approaches and validated our findings using reported consumption values as
  well as results from another model in use. We found that using per capita values
  for consumption is satisfactory for counties, but consumption in municipalities
  and metropolitan areas with populations smaller than 500,000 inhabitants was better
  described by one of the suggested methods on average.  '
