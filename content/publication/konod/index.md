abstract: 'Improving the sustainability performance of construction industry is driven
  by two forces: regulatory push (policy initiatives), and market pull where improving
  a corporate sustainability performance can be financially beneficial for enterprises.
  Through the investigation of the sustainability hotspots and impacts, concerning
  social and environmental, of the steel slag mixed concrete (green concrete) the
  study assessed the factors relevant for its performance and examined how to improve
  them. Hotspot analysis and impact assessments were conducted by social and environmental
  life cycle assessment (LCA). The assessed green concrete represented not just the
  variety of geographic representation but also the product designs (three different
  slag contents) and the potential difference occurring from the corporate efforts,
  where four classes were introduced. The investigation of the social and environmental
  hotspots of the green concrete revealed a difference in the relation between the
  sustainability performance and steel slags. While the increased slag content resulted
  in worse social performance, the increase improved the environmental performance
  in all six investigated case countries. This trade-off between the social and environmental
  performance implied the limits of the sustainable product design and suggested the
  effectiveness of the supply chain management for improving the two sustainability
  performances for the green concrete.  '
