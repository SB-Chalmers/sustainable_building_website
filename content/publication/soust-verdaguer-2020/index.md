abstract: 'Introduction: The application of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique
  to a building requires the collection and organization of a large amount of data
  over its life cycle. The systematic decomposition method can be used to classify
  building components, elements and materials, overcome specific difficulties that
  are encountered when attempting to complete the life cycle inventory and increase
  the reliability and transparency of results. In this paper, which was developed
  in the context of the research project IEA EBC Annex 72, we demonstrate the implications
  of taking such approach and describe the results of a comparison among different
  national standards/guidelines that are used to conduct LCA for building decomposition.
  Methods: We initially identified the main characteristics of the standards/guidelines
  used by Annex participant countries. The “be2226” reference office building was
  used as a reference to apply the different national standards/guidelines related
  to building decomposition. It served as a basis of comparison, allowing us to identify
  the implications of using different systems/standards in the LCA practice, in terms
  of how these differences affect the LCI structures, LCA databases and the methods
  used to communicate results. We also analyzed the implications of integrating these
  standards/guidelines into Building Information Modelling (BIM) to support LCA. Results:
  Twelve national classification systems/ standards/guidelines for the building decomposition
  were compared. Differences were identified among the levels of decomposition and
  grouping principles, as well as the consequences of these differences that were
  related to the LCI organization. In addition, differences were observed among the
  LCA databases and the structures of the results. Conclusions: The findings of this
  study summarize and provide an overview of the most relevant aspects of using a
  standardized building decomposition structure to conduct LCA. Recommendations are
  formulated on the basis of these findings.'
