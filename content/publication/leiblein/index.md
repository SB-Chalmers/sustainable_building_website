abstract: "Analyses in this study focus on characteristics of three different clusters\
  \ of ventilation for office buildings. These comprise natural, mechanical and hybrid\
  \ ventilation. In a major project study, extensive data was collected from 27 office\
  \ buildings. Besides physically measurable parameters, psycho-social-oriented surveys\
  \ of building users and information about building-specific constructional or building\
  \ technology were compiled. In a selection, results of indoor air quality (IAQ)\
  \ and indoor environment quality (IEQ) were compared with current standards. Thom's\
  \ Discomfort Index (DI) suggested that, for all three clusters, populations feeling\
  \ discomfort are to be expected during the summer months. Responses for certain\
  \ aspects corresponding to IEQ and IAQ showed a remarkable seasonal divergence of\
  \ satisfaction with air temperature for naturally ventilated buildings. The appearance\
  \ of stagnant air is found to occur in its strongest form in naturally and hybrid\
  \ ventilated buildings. Mechanically ventilated buildings were reported as having\
  \ the lowest values for satisfaction with air humidity in winter. Each ventilation\
  \ system comprises characteristic advantages and disadvantages. A tendency might\
  \ favour, at least seasonally, mechanically or hybrid ventilated buildings. Differences\
  \ between these two systems are not significant in this sample. The result raises\
  \ the question of how much technical effort is actually necessary to provide satisfactory\
  \ ventilation.  "
