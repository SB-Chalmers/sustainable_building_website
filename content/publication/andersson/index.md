abstract: "In 2010, the world's buildings accounted for approximately 19% of all greenhouse\
  \ gas emissions. These emissions stem from both the construction and operation of\
  \ buildings. In recent years the carbon efficiency of energy sources and energy\
  \ efficiency of new buildings has been improved in Sweden. Therefore, embodied emissions\
  \ accounts for an increasing share of the life cycle emissions of new buildings.\
  \ This study aims to asses the cost effectiveness in abatement of embodied emissions.\
  \ This was done by assessing the embodied emissions of a case building and several\
  \ conventional design measures along with the implication on production cost. It\
  \ was found that many of the measures enabled cost effective carbon abatement. Embodied\
  \ emissions could be reduced by 15% using cost neutral or nearly cost neutral measures.\
  \ Abatements up to 18% were found cost effective in relation to abatement of carbon\
  \ dioxide emissions in other sectors. Abatements up to 24% were possible with minor\
  \ increases in total production cost (0.22%) even though some of the individual\
  \ measures were found expensive in relation to abatement of carbon dioxide emissions\
  \ in other sectors. Some measures entailed increased floor area that could potentially\
  \ lead to economic gain where exterior area is a limiting factor. Acoustic requirements\
  \ were found to be a limiting factor in abatement of embodied emissions.  "
