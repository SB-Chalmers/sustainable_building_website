abstract: "Given the global trends of rising energy demand and the increasing utilization\
  \ of low-grade renewable energy, low-temperature heating systems can play key roles\
  \ in improving building energy efficiency while providing a comfortable indoor environment.\
  \ To meet the need to retrofit existing buildings in Nordic countries for greater\
  \ energy efficiency, this study focused on human subjects' thermal sensation, thermal\
  \ comfort, thermal acceptability, draft acceptability, and perceived air quality\
  \ when three low-temperatureheating systems were used: conventional radiator, ventilation\
  \ radiator, or floor heating with exhaust ventilation. Human subject tests were\
  \ carried out in the climate chamber at the Technical University of Denmark. In\
  \ total, 24 human subjects, 12 females and 12 males, participated in the tests during\
  \ the winter season. The results show that no significant differences in thermal\
  \ sensation and thermal comfort between the three heating systems. Ventilation radiator\
  \ promised a comfortable indoor environment with a decreased watersupply temperature\
  \ and floor heating with exhaust ventilation can provide a basic thermal comfort\
  \ level. Thermal acceptability and draft acceptability show variations in different\
  \ heating systems. Gender has significant influences on thermal sensation, draft\
  \ acceptability, and preference of clo values. Personal thermal preference is observed\
  \ between males and females. The males prefer to dress lighter than the females,\
  \ but both can get the same thermal comfort level. It is concluded that low-temperature\
  \ heating systems using exhaust air ventilation are a potentially solution when\
  \ buildings are being retrofitted for improved energy efficiency and comfort of\
  \ the occupants.  "
