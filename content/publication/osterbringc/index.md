abstract: 'Urban building-stocks are responsible for a significant share of resource
  and energy use. To quantify the potential for reducing energy and environmental
  impact, building-stock modelling (BSM) is commonly used. Recently, the focus of
  BSM has expanded to include environmental impacts and life-cycle assessment (LCA).
  However, impact categories are often limited to climate change and representative
  buildings are often used. In addition, the future state of the stock is often calculated
  as a step-change to highlight the technical potential of an ideal future state.
  The aim of this paper is to assess the environmental impact of the future development
  of an urban housing-stock under business-as-usual scenarios using a building-specific
  GIS based model applied to the multi-family building stock of the City of Gothenburg.
  This paper uses an explorative LCA to account for environmental impacts based on
  dynamic uptake of common renovation measures and resulting energy savings until
  2050. Two main scenarios are used where the renovation logic is based on either
  end-of-life of components or cost-effectiveness and further divided using limiting
  factors regarding investment capacity and annual share of the stock to be renovated.
  Results show possible energy savings of up to 23% and a corresponding 31% reduction
  in greenhouse-gas emissions. Greenhouse-gas emissions avoided due to reduced energy
  demand are offset by up to 65% by accounting for material use due to construction
  related renovation measures. For scenarios that favour construction related interventions,
  PV panels are responsible for the major part of the environmental impact across
  the 15 mid-point indicators used.  '
