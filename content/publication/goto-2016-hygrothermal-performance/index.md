abstract: 'The construction industry is known to be a key contributor to manmade climate
  change. Amongst other nations, Japan has a building energy efficiency goal which
  does not yet emphasize the importance of the moisture safety design of well-insulated
  building envelopes considering its diverse climatic conditions. The authors developed
  a vapor-open wooden building envelope for the subtropical conditions of Japan and
  optimized a design method, which considers environmental, economic and hygrothermal
  aspects. As a case study, a detached residential building has been constructed in
  Ohmihachiman (central Japan). The building has been monitored using a large number
  of temperature and humidity sensors inside the walls and the roof. Results have
  been obtained from measurements over a period of one year. Furthermore, transient
  hygrothermal simulations using the measured exterior and interior climates have
  been carried out. It was shown that 1) the construction of the wall was successful
  with the desired level of air-tightness and 2) the simulation model by a commercial
  software is applicable for predicting the hygrothermal performance of the wall with
  the envelope system in the actual use condition.  '
