abstract: 'Cities and their building stock represent one of the largest energy consumer
  groups and emitters of greenhouse gases (GHG). The urban building stock, including
  commercial buildings, offers a large and mostly untapped potential for energy efficiency
  improvement and GHG mitigation. Urban development, building stock alterations, and
  building technology measures therefore play a major role in setting the framework
  to exploit these potentials. A way to describe possible building stock development
  pathways is through building stock modelling. Although there have been many different
  bottom-up approaches that model energy demand and GHG emissions as well as other
  aspects of urban development, they have not been fully integrated and are not giving
  community energy planners, urban planners and decision makers enough information
  to influence the development in specific areas and technological fields. The building
  stock model presented in this paper gives the possibility to model energy supply
  and demand of both the residential and non-residential building stock at the scale
  of individual buildings, taking into account both heating and cooling demand (and
  other energy services) of buildings of various types and age classes. The model
  allows for tapping into spatially differentiated potentials and to balance demand
  and supply and renewable energy source (RES) potentials at a local scale (typically
  small-scale neighbourhoods and hectares) to guide the planning and development of
  sustainable cities. It is shown that commercial buildings in particular play a key
  role in initiating thermal energy network approaches (e.g. local low-temperature
  networks). Furthermore, the possibility to connect with other models e.g. through
  the Smart Urban Adapt (SUA) modelling platform, makes it possible to run a fully
  integrated, bottom-up simulation of different urban development scenarios and their
  impact on energy demand and GHG emissions taking into account all aspects of urban
  development. The SUA modelling platform provides a highly integrated model, taking
  into account energy, land use and urban design, in order to investigate the socio-economic
  drivers of energy consumption. The results of a concrete case study revealed the
  benefit of integrating energy efficient commercial buildings with district energy
  systems that allow for tapping local potentials of renewable energy sources, for
  both heating and cooling.  '
