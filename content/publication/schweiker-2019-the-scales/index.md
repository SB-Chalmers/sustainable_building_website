abstract: "Thermal discomfort is one of the main triggers for occupants' interactions\
  \ with components of the built environment such as adjustments of thermostats and/or\
  \ opening windows and strongly related to the energy use in buildings. Understanding\
  \ causes for thermal (dis-)comfort is crucial for design and operation of any type\
  \ of building. The assessment of human thermal perception through rating scales,\
  \ for example in post-occupancy studies, has been applied for several decades; however,\
  \ long-existing assumptions related to these rating scales had been questioned by\
  \ several researchers. The aim of this study was to gain deeper knowledge on contextual\
  \ influences on the interpretation of thermal perception scales and their verbal\
  \ anchors by survey participants. A questionnaire was designed and consequently\
  \ applied in 21 language versions. These surveys were conducted in 57 cities in\
  \ 30 countries resulting in a dataset containing responses from 8225 participants.\
  \ The database offers potential for further analysis in the areas of building design\
  \ and operation, psycho-physical relationships between human perception and the\
  \ built environment, and linguistic analyses.  "
