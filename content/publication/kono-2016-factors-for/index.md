abstract: 'Thermal insulation material is an important component to reduce the environmental
  impact of buildings through the reduction of energy consumption in the operation
  phase. However, the material itself has embodied environmental impacts for the value
  it provides. Eco-efficiency is a method that quantifies relation between the environmental
  performance and the created value of a product system. This study investigated contributing
  factors of the eco-efficiency of thermal insulation materials to support decision
  making of material manufacturers. For the improvement of eco-efficiency, the assessment
  was made in two scopes: investigating the contributing factors of impact caused
  at production processes; and thermal performance through thermo-physical properties.
  For quantifying environmental impacts, cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA)
  of each materials were made. The life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) indicators
  used were ReCiPe H/A and global warming potential (GWP100a). For the assessment
  of production process, the inventories of the materials were assigned to six categories:
  heat, chemicals, electricity, transportation, raw materials and wastes. Among the
  assessed materials, contribution of electricity and heat within the production process
  was large for foam glass which had the highest potential to improve the eco-efficiency
  which was by factor 1.72. The analysis on relation between thermo-physical properties
  and eco-efficiency based on product data of the materials highlighted the importance
  of density as an indicator upon development and use. Although density often gains
  less attention, the finding suggested the effectiveness of improving the efficiency
  by having lower density without compensating the performance of the materials.  '
