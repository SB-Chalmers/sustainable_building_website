abstract: 'The Fixotek project is testing if dedicated community spaces in residential
  areas could help encourage residents to fix, lend, swap and recycle consumer products,
  thereby preventing waste generation and recovering resources locally. Four Fixoteks
  have been developed, in districts with different socioeconomic conditions in Gothenburg,
  offering regular open hours and events. The idea has been very well received by
  the community, with differences in how easily it has been taken up in some of the
  locations. Two of the Fixoteks engage local volunteers and have developed closer
  to local initiatives, while in the other two more efforts are needed to engage the
  local community. Non the less, the locations have allowed residents to reuse and
  repair beyond what was possible before. The project has been implemented with a
  multi-stakeholder consortium, which has given it a holistic approach to the implementation,
  but makes decision taking slow.  '
