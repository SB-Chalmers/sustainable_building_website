abstract: 'The use of timber and the implementation of the concept of circularity
  in the process of the construction of buildings potentially has a high sustainability
  impact, both from the perspective of material and construction technique. The three
  most effective ways to ensure the benefit of the circularity in the building sector
  in general are (1) maintain the service life of structures and buildings materials
  as long as possible to avoid unnecessary emissions and costs for demolition and
  reconstruction (2) conserve the quality of materials as long as possible to avoid
  unnecessary emissions and costs for the replacement and processing of new materials
  and (3) recycle and repurpose only the parts and materials which cannot function
  any more for technical and/or socio-cultural reasons. In this paper an approach
  is discussed towards a more sustainable built environment by making buildings adaptable
  to the changes of demands and requirements to building functions and thus leading
  to an extended use of buildings in a maximum of life cycles. This design for adaption
  may enhance economic, social and environmental benefits to various stakeholders
  and key players related to the building process, i.e. developers, building owners,
  users, municipality and others.  '
