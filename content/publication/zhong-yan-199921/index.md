abstract: The Bρ-ΔE-Bρ-TOF techniques used for the identification and separation of
  radioactive nuclear beams (RNB) at RIBLL, are described. As a PF-type radioactive
  nuclear beam line, RIBLL can deliver RNB with high purity for light projectiles
  by using Bρ-ΔE-Bρ techniques, while for heavy ones, the Bρ-ΔE-Bρ-TOF methods must
  be adopted in order to identify the RNB clearly. © 1999 Chin. Phys. Soc.
