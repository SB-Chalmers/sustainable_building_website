abstract: 'Combined heat and power (CHP) production in buildings is one of the mitigation
  options available for achieving a considerable decrease in GHG emissions. Micro-CHP
  (mCHP) fuel cells are capable of cogenerating electricity and heat very efficiently
  on a decentralised basis. Although they offer clear environmental benefits and have
  the potential to create a systemic change in energy provision, the diffusion of
  mCHP fuel cells is rather slow. There are numerous potential drivers for the successful
  diffusion of fuel cell cogeneration units, but key economic actors are often unaware
  of them. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive analysis of barriers,
  drivers and business opportunities surrounding micro-CHP fuel-cell units (up to
  5 kWel) in the German building market. Business opportunities have been identified
  based not only on quantitative data for drivers and barriers, but also on discussions
  with relevant stakeholders such as housing associations, which are key institutional
  demand-side actors. These business opportunities include fuel cell contracting as
  well as the development of a large lighthouse project to demonstrate the climate-neutral,
  efficient use of fuel cells in the residential building sector. The next step could
  involve the examination and development of more detailed options and business models.
  The approach and methods used in the survey may be applied on a larger scale and
  in other sectors.  '
