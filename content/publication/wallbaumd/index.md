abstract: "The building stock is one of the biggest energy and resource consumers\
  \ worldwide. Different building stock models have been developed in order to investigate\
  \ the potentials of energy-efficiency measures and changes in energy supply systems\
  \ in the building stock. In this context and on behalf of the city of Zurich a life\
  \ cycle-based building stock model has been designed to assess the greenhouse gas\
  \ emissions as well as the primary energy reduction potential from the building\
  \ sector in order to achieve the so-called goals of the “2000 Watt society” by the\
  \ year 2050. However, building stock models often have important shortcomings since\
  \ they merely focus on the heating energy demand in the usage phase, neglecting\
  \ the ”embodied energy” demand of construction materials, building technologies\
  \ and energy carriers. The goal of the project described in this paper is to provide\
  \ an estimation of the embodied energy associated to the construction and renovation\
  \ activities in the building park in the city of Zurich. The embodied energy in\
  \ Zurich building stock by building new construction and renovation cumulates to\
  \ 1'796 TJ per year (Reference scenario), 2'270 TJ per year (Efficiency scenario)\
  \ and 2'304 TJ per year (Eco-efficiency scenario) in 2050. In other words, the embodied\
  \ energy is roughly 10% of the operating energy and already 190 Watt per capita.\
  \ The differentiation by construction element reveals interesting findings, for\
  \ instance the high importance of flat roofs, electrical appliances, heating distribution,\
  \ air conditioning, sanitation and wall cladding that are often excluded in current\
  \ environmental assessments.  "
