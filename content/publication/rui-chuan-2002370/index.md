abstract: Isoverbascoside, a phenylethanoid glycoside, was isolated from Chinese folk
  medicine herb Pedicularis striata Pall. Here we report that isoverbascoside is capable
  of inducing differentiation in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line SMMC-7721.
  When treated with isoverbascoside, the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells was markedly
  inhibited in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and the average cell population
  doubling time was delayed. Exposure of cells to 20 μmol/l isoverbascoside led to
  the decline of colony formation efficiency on soft agar, induced G0/G1 arresting,
  and resulted in the decrease of γ-glutamyltransferase (γ-GT) activity and the increase
  of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) activity, two marker enzymes, respectively, representing
  ing HCC malignance and differentiation stage. These results suggest that isoverbascoside
  possess the activity of inducing differentiation in SMMC-7721 cells.
