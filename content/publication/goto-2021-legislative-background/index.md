abstract: 'Standards and design codes are necessary to guarantee the desired safety
  and performance of structures. With regard to timber structures, considerable differences
  exist in the standards and design codes between Europe and Japan. In this contribution
  the framework of design codes for timber structure in Europe and Japan is compared.
  The fundamental approach in the structural planning, application of load and associated
  fire regulation is explained. Furthermore, a case study of the structural design
  of a 3-storey residential building with light-frame timber structure is performed
  to highlight the differences in the structural calculation and design approaches
  in construction details. Finally, potential optimization of different standards
  is suggested.  '
