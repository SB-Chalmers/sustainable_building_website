abstract: Considering the prediction accuracy of health parameter in Engine Health
  Management (EHM) system used for aero-engine, a new compensation mechanism is proposed.
  The differences in the individuals of the same type engines and engine degradation
  after the use both will result in the modeling errors, while reducing the modeling
  errors is a key to improve the precision of fault diagnosis. A discrete series predictor
  based on multi-outputs least square support vector regression (LSSVR) is applied
  to the compensation of on-board self tuning model of aero-engine, and particle swarm
  optimization(PSO) is used to the kernels selection of multi-outputs LSSVR. The experimental
  results show that this compensation mechanism need not the model structure characteristics,
  compared with the other known approaches the aero-engine model has better generalization
  ability and higher prediction accuracy of health parameter. Â© 2008 IEEE.
