abstract: 'Most digital tools developed for architects and urban planners cater to
  the environmental and economic dimensions of SD, leaving out the social dimension.
  SoSu as a dimension of SD lacks the analytical ability available to the economic
  and environmental dimensions in addressing the environmental and economic impacts
  of design decisions enabling a shorter feedback loop in the early design stage.
  In this paper, we implement a seven-step conceptual analysis methodology framework
  to explore (a) – the theoretical background of SoSu and (b) – to develop a user
  interaction model that can serve as a blueprint to develop digital tools to promote
  SoSu in the early stages of neighbourhood design. The theoretical background is
  developed in the first three steps – Mapping selected data sources, extensive reading
  and categorising selected data, and identifying and naming concepts. The model development
  further builds on the results of part (a) and involves deconstructing and categorising
  the concepts, integrating concepts and synthesis and re-synthesis of the concept.
  Finally, the seventh step consists of validating the conceptual framework through
  public discussion. We identify architects and urban planners as the target user
  group and the neighbourhood scale to apply SoSu concepts in the built environment
  and propose pre-requisites following a four-step user interaction model to develop
  digital tools to promote SoSu.  '
