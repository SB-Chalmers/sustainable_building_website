 abstract = {Most digital tools developed for architects and urban planners cater to the environmental and economic dimensions of SD, leaving out the social dimension. SoSu as a dimension of SD lacks the analytical ability available to the economic and environmental dimensions in addressing the environmental and economic impacts of design decisions enabling a shorter feedback loop in the early design stage. In this paper, we implement a seven-step conceptual analysis methodology framework to explore (a) – the theoretical background of SoSu and (b) – to develop a user interaction model that can serve as a blueprint to develop digital tools to promote SoSu in the early stages of neighbourhood design. The theoretical background is developed in the first three steps – Mapping selected data sources, extensive reading and categorising selected data, and identifying and naming concepts. The model development further builds on the results of part (a) and involves deconstructing and categorising the concepts, integrating concepts and synthesis and re-synthesis of the concept. Finally, the seventh step consists of validating the conceptual framework through public discussion. We identify architects and urban planners as the target user group and the neighbourhood scale to apply SoSu concepts in the built environment and propose pre-requisites following a four-step user interaction model to develop digital tools to promote SoSu.  },
