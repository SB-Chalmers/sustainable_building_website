abstract: 'Improving the energy performance in the real estate sector has become increasingly
  important and drawn a lot of attention during the past few decades. Despite all
  the technological developments, the energy efficiency measures are yet expensive
  and when implemented only to improve the energy performance, are rarely economically
  justified. To lower the costs of energy performance improvements, an alternative
  is to combine energy efficiency measures with already required renovation measures.
  The problem with renovation on the other hand, is that its planning is not strategic;
  it is mainly opportunistic, short-term and with the focus on the capitalization
  of newly-discovered opportunities, meaning that renovation measures are coupled
  when one or more of the rather costly building components have reached failure.
  The take on an opportunistic approach, however convenient, results in loss of value
  which is most often neglected in the economic evaluation of renovation projects.
  The lack of strategic planning and the subsequent loss of value become more important
  in less-attractive markets, where there are both budget constraints and socio-economic
  issues. Energy performance and/or living standard are often sacrificed through improper
  distribution of resources as the choice of renovation measures are often influenced
  by the return of investment. Therefore, a proper evaluation of renovation alternatives
  not only can satisfy the technical and financial requirements but also help maintain
  proper living standard and improve the energy performance in multifamily buildings.
  In a prior study, authors have proposed a systematic approach to cost-optimal maintenance
  and renovation planning by combining the deterioration function of building components
  with respective service-life cycle costing. This paper presents an extension of
  that methodology to include the energy efficiency option pricing as an optimization
  criterion. The extended methodology is meant to provide support for housing owners
  in building management in forms of technical and economic evaluation of possible
  energy-renovation scenarios under time/budget constraints. To demonstrate the application
  of the methodology, maintenance/renovation plans are devised for three building
  components with sharing fixed costs (windows, faöade and roof) in both new and existing
  multifamily buildings.  '
