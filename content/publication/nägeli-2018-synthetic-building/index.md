abstract: 'In Europe, the final energy demand and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of
  residential and commercial building stocks account for approximately 40% of energy
  and emissions. A building stock model (BSM) is a method of assessing the energy
  demand and GHG emissions of building stocks and developing pathways for energy and
  GHG emission reduction. The most common approach to building stock modeling is to
  construct archetypes that are taken to representing large segments of the stock.
  This paper introduces a new method of building stock modeling based on the generation
  of synthetic building stocks. By drawing on relevant research, the developed methodology
  uses aggregate national data and combines it with various data sources to generate
  a disaggregated synthetic building stock. The methodology is implemented and validated
  for the residential building stock of Switzerland. The results demonstrate that
  the energy demand and GHG emissions can vary greatly across the stock. These and
  other indicators vary significantly within common building stock segments that consider
  only few attributes such as building type and construction period. Furthermore,
  the results indicate a separation of the stock in terms of GHG emissions between
  old fossil fuel-heated buildings and new and refurbished buildings that are heated
  by renewable energy. Generating a disaggregated synthetic building stock allows
  for a discrete representation of various building states. This enables a more realistic
  representation of past building stock alterations, such as refurbishment, compared
  with commonly used archetypes, and not relying on more extensive data sources and
  being able to accommodate a wide variation of data types. The developed methodology
  can be extended in numerous manners and lays groundwork for future studies.  '
