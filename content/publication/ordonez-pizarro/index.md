abstract: 'The reuse and remanufacturing of materials in urban areas is an important
  step towards closing local material cycles. Despite high potential, the use of these
  materials is currently hampered by various reasons, such as lack of coordination
  or insufficient exchange between the actors. There is no central point of contact
  at city level for bundling competencies in this field. The importance and possibility
  of establishing a central Center for Urban Re-manufacture (CURE) for sorting, storing
  and preparing for reuse and re-manufacturing of these materials was investigated
  in Gothenburg and Berlin, in a EIT Climate-KIC Pathfinder project. This article
  summarizes the findings and lessons of that project, which include an initiative
  review, market analyses, and participative workshops in both cities. The studies
  show that Gothenburg had a strong local authority engagement in the topic, while
  Berlin counted with several independent organizations already providing reuse services.
  The project managed to generate interest in this topic among local actors in both
  cities, which will hopefully result in the future establishment of some type of
  CURE in these locations. The article concludes that a combination of bottom-up and
  top-down engagement is needed to provide material recovery services at a city scale,
  involving stakeholders from across the existing material value chains.  '
