 abstract = {This research investigates methodologies of Social Life Cycle Assessment (S-LCA) and Green Building Certification Systems (GBCS) along with the European standard EN 16309 for social performance assessment for buildings. We follow a two-step approach of first reviewing methods used to perform an S-LCA in the literature and then comparing the methods to GBCS and EN 16309 regarding their coverage of S-LCA subcategories. Two fundamental differences lie in the targeted life cycle stages and stakeholders. UNEP/SETAC guidelines for S-LCA tend to be dominant in the “production” stage, whereas, GBCS and EN 16309 focus predominantly on the “use” stage of the lifecycle. GBCS and EN 16309 methodologies focus on the “consumer” (building occupant) and “local community” stakeholders. Extending the scope of the rating systems across more stakeholders and life cycle stages to include S-LCA subcategories could lead to greater awareness and application of the S-LCA concept in the building and construction sector.  },
