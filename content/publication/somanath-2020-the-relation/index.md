abstract: 'This research investigates methodologies of Social Life Cycle Assessment
  (S-LCA) and Green Building Certification Systems (GBCS) along with the European
  standard EN 16309 for social performance assessment for buildings. We follow a two-step
  approach of first reviewing methods used to perform an S-LCA in the literature and
  then comparing the methods to GBCS and EN 16309 regarding their coverage of S-LCA
  subcategories. Two fundamental differences lie in the targeted life cycle stages
  and stakeholders. UNEP/SETAC guidelines for S-LCA tend to be dominant in the “production”
  stage, whereas, GBCS and EN 16309 focus predominantly on the “use” stage of the
  lifecycle. GBCS and EN 16309 methodologies focus on the “consumer” (building occupant)
  and “local community” stakeholders. Extending the scope of the rating systems across
  more stakeholders and life cycle stages to include S-LCA subcategories could lead
  to greater awareness and application of the S-LCA concept in the building and construction
  sector.  '
