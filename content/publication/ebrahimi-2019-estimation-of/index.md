abstract: 'Combinations of different factors and their relative importance have a
  mixed effect on the longevity of pavements, which are essential to be understood
  to enhance long-term maintenance planning. This study used spatial road data from
  Norway followed by integrating temporal-spatial and statistical analyses to show
  a potential approach to estimate the lifetimes of asphalt surfacing. For the statistical
  part, a stratified Cox proportional hazard model was used to understand the relationship
  between longevity of surface mixtures and different factors, while avoiding having
  predefined assumptions rooted in deterministic modeling. In addition, rutting was
  used as the response variable to determine distress-specific asphalt surfacing lifetimes
  and to handle censored data. Inclusion of rutting as the response variable showed
  that the median technical lifetime of asphalt surfacing is about 2Â years shorter
  than that of the maintenance activity records. The results showed the significance
  of each covariate; however, aggregate nominal maximum size and heavy traffic volume
  were consistently the significant covariates across the studied traffic classes.
  In addition, the results were fitted to reference categories in each covariate to
  show a practical approach to interpret absolute values of lifetimes from a survival
  table.  '
