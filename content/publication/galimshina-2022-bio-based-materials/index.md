abstract: 'Boosting building renovation is urgently needed to achieve carbon neutrality
  by 2050. Building retrofit can be achieved by energy-efficient measures such as
  thermal insulation or replacement of a fossil heating system. Currently, conventional
  materials that are mostly used for envelope insulation raising the risk of a lock-in
  situation where measures to mitigate climate change are actually contributing to
  it. Bio-based materials are a promising alternative as they can be used to not only
  reduce the energy consumption of a building but also temporarily store carbon. To
  evaluate the potential benefits of such materials, life cycle assessment (LCA) and
  life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) are commonly used. Such assessment allows the analysis
  of a building over its whole life. However, considering that buildings are very
  long lasting systems, many associated uncertainties can affect the outcome of LCA
  and LCCA. To account for all the uncertainty sources and provide a robust solution
  for building renovation, uncertainty quantification can be applied. In this paper,
  we use robust optimization under uncertainties to define the most cost-effective
  and climate-friendly solution. We apply bio-based materials and include carbon storage
  calculation in the integrated LCA and LCCA. For the robust optimization, we use
  a novel methodology combining a well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm
  II (NSGA-II) with surrogate modeling to lower computational cost. The methodology
  is applied for a case study located in Switzerland. The results show that bio-based
  materials provide a robust solution for building renovation but to achieve the highest
  reduction potential, bio-based envelope insulation should be combined with the replacement
  of the existing fossil heating system.  '
