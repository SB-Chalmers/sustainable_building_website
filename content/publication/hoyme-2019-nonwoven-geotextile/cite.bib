 abstract = {The sand surrounding a construction (e.g. monopile) for mounting an offshore wind turbine, could be scoured due to the affection of natural water flow at the ocean floor. To tackle the phenomena, scour protection methods have been established. Mostly rocks are used, but also one alternative, described in this paper, has been used already successfully: The installation of Geotextile Sand Containers.  },
