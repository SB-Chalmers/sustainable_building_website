abstract: 'This article explores the importance of building spaces in residential
  areas to encourage waste prevention through product reuse. First, a short review
  is made over five existing spaces that allow residents to leave and take products
  to be used again by others. Then, the initial experiences of establishing such a
  space in the HSB Living Lab in Gothenburg are presented to complement the review.
  In general the experiences of establishing these rooms for change are positive,
  with users making use of the space frequently. Aspects such as location and open
  hours are crucial to make the change-stations convenient for residents to use. Making
  the space available to a large group ofpeople is important to ensure good product
  flow and renewal. Even though these spaces enable product exchange between users,
  it is not always possible to link this exchange to a measureable effect on reduced
  waste generation or consumption. It is not always true that the items exchangedwould
  have been discarded or purchased if the space to change them was not available.
  There is an exception when the exchanged items are food, since the food made available
  for others to take would have been wasted otherwise.  '
