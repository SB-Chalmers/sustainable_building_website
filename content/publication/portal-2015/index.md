abstract: The building construction industry is in need of sustainable materials and
  solutions. A novel building material, such as textilereinforced concrete (TRC),
  could be used to meet this demand. Textile-reinforced concrete is a combination
  of fine-grained concrete and multiaxial textile fabrics that has been fundamentally
  researched over the past decade. TRC-based research has explored various facets
  of this composite material, such as its structural functionality, production, applicability,
  and design. One key aspect that is still missing, however, is a comprehensive review
  of the sustainable potential of this material in terms of its input-output and durability
  that suitably answers to requirement No. 7 of EU's Construction Products Regulation.
  This article provides qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the sustainable
  potential and prospective development of TRC particularly reinforced by alkali-resistant
  (AR) glass, carbon, or basalt fibers. Based on the outcome of this evaluation, carbon
  textile fibers were observed to hold the optimal potential mechanical behavior;
  additionally, it was revealed through the conducted life-cycle assessment (LCA)
  that basalt had the least cumulative energy demand, whereas carbon had the least
  environmental impact. Â© 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.
