 abstract = {Education efforts, both at Chalmers and elsewhere, could be developed to better suit the needs of competences that would help with solving the societal challenges of coming and current generations. The educational framework Dare2Build aims to be a part of this development by immersing its students in cross-disciplinary teams, working with co-creational methods, to solve practice based tasks. The proximity to the explorative research environment surrounding a living lab, and the prototyping infrastructure in particular, the HSB Living Lab, is expected to incorporate innovation and entrepreneurship into the participantsâ€™ learning experiences and thereby promote utilization of activities of the university sphere.  },
