abstract: 'Education efforts, both at Chalmers and elsewhere, could be developed to
  better suit the needs of competences that would help with solving the societal challenges
  of coming and current generations. The educational framework Dare2Build aims to
  be a part of this development by immersing its students in cross-disciplinary teams,
  working with co-creational methods, to solve practice based tasks. The proximity
  to the explorative research environment surrounding a living lab, and the prototyping
  infrastructure in particular, the HSB Living Lab, is expected to incorporate innovation
  and entrepreneurship into the participantsâ€™ learning experiences and thereby promote
  utilization of activities of the university sphere.  '
