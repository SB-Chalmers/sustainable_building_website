 abstract = {The effects of different blending ratio on the properties of UHMWPE/PP blends were studied in this paper. The result shows that when PP mass fraction is 50%, the heat deflection temperature of the blend is 90°Cwhich is 1.8 times higher than UHMWPE. While the wearability of UHMWPE/PP is decreased due to the addition of PP, it can be improved compensably by wear-resisting additives. And the notched impact strength of the blends is improved with the increasing content of UHMWPE. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications.},
