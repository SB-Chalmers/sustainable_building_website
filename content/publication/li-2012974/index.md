abstract: The effects of different blending ratio on the properties of UHMWPE/PP blends
  were studied in this paper. The result shows that when PP mass fraction is 50%,
  the heat deflection temperature of the blend is 90°Cwhich is 1.8 times higher than
  UHMWPE. While the wearability of UHMWPE/PP is decreased due to the addition of PP,
  it can be improved compensably by wear-resisting additives. And the notched impact
  strength of the blends is improved with the increasing content of UHMWPE. © (2012)
