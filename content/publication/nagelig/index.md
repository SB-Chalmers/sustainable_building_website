abstract: "In light of the Swiss government's reduction targets for greenhouse gas\
  \ (GHG) emissions under the Paris Agreement, this article investigates how and with\
  \ which policy measures these reduction targets can be met for the Swiss residential\
  \ building sector. The paper applies an agent-based building stock model to simulate\
  \ the development of the Swiss residential building stock under three different\
  \ policy scenarios. The scenario results until 2050 are compared against the reduction\
  \ targets set by the Swiss government and with each other. The results indicate\
  \ that while the current state of Swiss climate policy is effective in reducing\
  \ energy demand and GHG emissions, it will not be enough to reach the ambitious\
  \ emission-reduction targets. These targets can be reached only through an almost\
  \ complete phase-out of fossil-fuel heating systems by 2050, which can be achieved\
  \ through the introduction of further financial and/or regulatory measures. The\
  \ results indicate that while financial measures such as an increase in the CO2\
  \ tax as well as subsidies are effective in speeding up the transition in the beginning,\
  \ a complete phase-out of oil and gas by 2050 is reached only through additional\
  \ regulatory measures such as a CO2 limit for new and existing buildings.  "
