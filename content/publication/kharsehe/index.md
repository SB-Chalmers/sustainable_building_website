abstract: '© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. The current work
  investigates how adding a battery of optimal capacity to a grid-connected photovoltaic
  (PV) system can improve its economic feasibility. Also, the effect of different
  parameters on the feasibility of the PV system was evaluated. The optimal battery
  capacity (OBC) was determined for different saving targets of the annual electricity
  consumption of the chosen building. For this aim, real electricity consumption data
  of a residential building in Landskrona, Sweden, was used as energy consumption
  profile. A Solar World SW325XL, which is a monocrystalline solar panel, was selected
  as PV panel. The calculations were performed under the metrological and economic
  conditions of southern Sweden. Different working parameters (WPs) were considered
  (prices of the battery, feed-in tariffs, and saving targets). The performed calculations
  show that the optimal battery capacity (OBC), in which the payback time (PBT) of
  the system is maximized, strongly depends on the WP. The proper selection of the
  battery can considerably increase the economic feasibility of the PV system in southern
  Sweden. However, in some cases, using battery can have a negative impact on the
  PBT of the system. The results show that the electricity price, the module price,
  the inverter price, and the inverter lifetime have the highest effect on the PBT.  '
