abstract: 'This work investigates the possibility of improving the economic performance
  of PV in Northern Europe. The PV system investigated in this study is assumed to
  be connected to the electricity grid. However, because there is a difference between
  the electricity tariff and feed-in electricity price, adding a battery to such a
  system improves its economic viability. But the application of a battery increases
  initial costs of the system. Therefore, it is especially of economic relevance to
  choose the optimal size of the battery. In this work, the optimal battery size was
  calculated under different parameters including electricity tariff, feed-in electricity
  price, and battery performance and price. For this purpose, an actual building located
  in Landskrona, Sweden was chosen as a case study. A computer model was built to
  simulate the PV system. The simulations show that the optimal battery size is strongly
  influenced by the local conditions especially the feed-in electricity price.  '
