abstract: 'Concerning the resource depletion and global warming, the realization of
  sustainable constructions is crucial because the building industry has a big impact
  on the greenhouse gas emission. Recently the interest in the buildings in subtropical
  regions has been growing due tothe high growth rate of their urbanized areas. From
  the view point of building physics, those regions are very challenging because they
  have both heating and cooling demand. Also the prediction of indoor air humidity
  is acquiring a greater interest concerning the envelopedurability, the comfort and
  the energy consumption, which is very relevant to such regions. Meanwhile, there
  is a need of developing a new construction system and its design method for subtropical
  regions since it is inappropriate to simply use the established construction systems
  for cold regions which have only heating demand.Based on the transient hydrothermal
  model of the envelope and the whole building heat and moisture balance model taking
  into account the moisture buffering by hygroscopic interior materials, the authors
  have developed an envelope system and its insulation optimization scheme which considers
  lifetime environmental impact, lifetime cost, durability, usersâ€™ behaviour and local
  climate. The envelope consists of natural materials such as wood and clay and thus
  allows the moderate transfer of the water vapour in both directions i.e. from exterior
  to interior and from interior to exterior. A detached house with this system was
  realized in Ohmihachiman (central Japan) in June 2013 and the indoor temperature
  and humidity havebeen monitored at several points. The measured indoor climate was
  analysed and it was revealed that 1. the indoor climate in summer has a certain
  improvement potential and 2. the indoor climate in winter is satisfying. As the
  monitoring of electricity generation by the photovoltaic panels and the electricityconsumption
  of the whole house has showed a positive balance (more generation than consumption),
  it is suggested to either use the cooling radiator more actively or install an active
  dehumidifier into the mechanical ventilation system to provide a more agreeable
  indoor climate in the summer. The former recommendation will be implemented in summer
  2015 and its impact on the comfort and energy consumption will be further analysed.  '
