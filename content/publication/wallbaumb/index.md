abstract: 'Geosynthetic materials are used in many different applications in the civil
  and underground engineering. In most cases, the use of geosynthetic material replaces
  the use of other materials. On behalf of the European Association for Geosynthetic
  Manufacturers (EAGM) the authors quantified the environmental performance of commonly
  applied construction materials (such as concrete, cement, lime or gravel) versus
  geosynthetics. To this end a set of comparative life cycle assessment studies are
  carried out, according to the ISO 14040 and 14044 standards, concentrating on various
  application cases, namely filtration, foundation stabilised road, landfill construction
  and slope retention. The environmental performance of geosynthetics is compared
  to the performance of competing construction materials used. The environmental impacts
  of the full life cycle of the four cases show overall the following results:• A
  filter using a geosynthetic layer causes lower impacts compared to a conventional
  gravel based filter layer with regard to all impact category indicators investigated.•
  A conventional road causes higher impacts compared to a road reinforced with geosynthetics
  with regard to all impact category indicators.• A geosynthetic drainage layer causes
  lower environmental impacts compared to a gravel based drainage layer in all impact
  categories considered except land competition which is about the same in both cases.•
  A geosynthetic reinforced wall causes lower environmental impacts compared to a
  reinforced concrete wall in all impact categories considered.  '
