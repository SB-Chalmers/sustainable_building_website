abstract: 'Material flow analysis (MFA) is a tool for research and decision support
  in environmental policy and management. In order to promote the use of MFA at different
  spatial scales, a quantification of the uncertainty in nationwide, regional, and
  urban MFA methodologies is provided. In particular, the impact of the input data
  quality on the main MFA indicators is analyzed and the sources and extent of uncertainties
  for different spatial scales are listed. The types, origin, and extent of the errors
  are described in detail and several imputation methods are explained and evaluated.
  By introducing a novel approach to account measurement errors in data sets with
  very few details on the measurement errors, this article aims at contributing to
  the development of a standardized method to account for the uncertainty in MFA studies.
  This study uses the time series of MFA data for 1996-2011 at three spatial scalesnationwide
  (Sweden), regional (the Stockholm Region), and metropolitan (Stockholm, Gothenburg,
  and Malmo)to determine how propagation of measurement errors affects the MFA results.
  The following MFA indicators were studied: direct material input; domestic processed
  output; and domestic material consumption. Generally, availability decreased as
  the spatial scale was lowered, whereas data errors increased. In the specific case
  of Sweden, the data on freight transport by rail and on waste produced by economic
  activities at the regional and metropolitan level should be improved.  '
