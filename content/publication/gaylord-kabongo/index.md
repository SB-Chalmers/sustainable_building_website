abstract: 'This paper presents an analysis of the effects of the geometry of a highway
  on fuel consumption of heavy-duty vehicles operating in eco-driving mode. Field
  data from a high traffic volume highway in Norway are used in this study. Vertical
  and horizontal profile layers of the same road sections are considered individually
  and merged with vehicle field data. The study includes a correlation and regression
  analysis to investigate the relationship between the road gradient and the rate
  of fuel consumption of a representative truck. The effect of road gradient is examined
  in both acceleration and deceleration (retardation) mode. Different models are devel-oped,
  which can serve as a tool for decision making at early design and planning phases
  of a highway project, where information on fuel consumption and its environmental
  impacts may influence design choices.  '
