 abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of the effects of the geometry of a highway on fuel consumption of heavy-duty vehicles operating in eco-driving mode. Field data from a high traffic volume highway in Norway are used in this study. Vertical and horizontal profile layers of the same road sections are considered individually and merged with vehicle field data. The study includes a correlation and regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the road gradient and the rate of fuel consumption of a representative truck. The effect of road gradient is examined in both acceleration and deceleration (retardation) mode. Different models are devel-oped, which can serve as a tool for decision making at early design and planning phases of a highway project, where information on fuel consumption and its environmental impacts may influence design choices.  },
