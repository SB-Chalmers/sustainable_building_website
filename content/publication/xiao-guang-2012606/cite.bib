 abstract = {Pit always changes its shape and size during corrosion fatigue. The actual morphology of pit is an outcome of the interaction between the variation in the elastic energy, surface energy and electrochemical energy stored in the cyclically stressed solid. In this paper, a two-variable semi-elliptical model is proposed to depict the pit's growing morphology. The critical condition for corrosion fatigue crack nucleation is deduced according to dislocation theory, and the influences of some important factors on critical pit size and crack nucleation life are discussed.
