abstract: Pit always changes its shape and size during corrosion fatigue. The actual
  morphology of pit is an outcome of the interaction between the variation in the
  elastic energy, surface energy and electrochemical energy stored in the cyclically
  stressed solid. In this paper, a two-variable semi-elliptical model is proposed
  to depict the pit's growing morphology. The critical condition for corrosion fatigue
  crack nucleation is deduced according to dislocation theory, and the influences
  of some important factors on critical pit size and crack nucleation life are discussed.
