abstract: 'The Smart Sustainable Offices project (SSO) is a product of years of research
  with large sets of data collected from more than 30 office buildings in Switzerland,
  Sweden, and Spain. Based on scientific evidence, the concept of SSO, initially conceived
  as a research plan to address the interdependencies between office users and their
  working environment in a European context, is now used as a qualitative and quantitative
  mixed method approach for office diagnosis and ideation. At the current stage, the
  SSO methodology aims to implement a new paradigm of user-oriented, lower carbon
  footprint and resilient office design solutions. The main strategy is articulated
  around the “office DNA” of every organisation, decoded as a compound of work patterns,
  operational and individual needs, and their potential to define design criteria.
  The practical application of SSO and its tentative findings exemplified through
  three pilot test office-demonstrators are described in this paper.  '
