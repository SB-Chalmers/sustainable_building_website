abstract: Digital tools for performance-assessment are commonly used to shorten
  the feedback loop in testing designs for buildings and neighbourhoods.
  However, these tools do not extend to the social dimension in the same way as
  the economic and environmental dimensions. This paper aims to contribute to
  the development of digital tools to design socially sustainable
  neighbourhoods. We analyse 115 academic articles to establish a theoretical
  understanding of Social Sustainability (SoSu). Based on these results, we
  propose a digital user-interaction model to operationalise SoSu in the digital
  design process of buildings. In the literature, we observe a lack of consensus
  on the theoretical discussion on SoSu. Several extrinsic and intrinsic factors
  are identified contributing to this fuzziness; the dependency on stakeholder
  value systems, the qualitative nature of social indicators, and comparison to
  environmental sustainability being the most common. Still, we distinguish two
  overarching categories, social equity and social capital, that are further
  divided into sub-themes. Having mapped the categories and hierarchies of
  social themes, we propose a user-interaction model that incorporates these
  findings into a digital environment. The user-interaction model creates a
  guided decision-making framework for architects and urban planners by enabling
  stakeholders to make conscious and informed decisions grounded in theory.
