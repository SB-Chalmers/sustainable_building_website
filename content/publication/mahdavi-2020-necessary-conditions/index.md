abstract: 'A discussion of sustainability in architecture cannot be meaningfully carried
  out without the inclusion of most buildings’ central purpose, namely the provision
  of indoor environments that are accommodating of occupants’ needs and requirements.
  To this end, building designers and operators are expected to demonstrate compliance
  with codes and standards pertaining to indoor environmental quality (IEQ). However,
  the majority of conventional IEQ standards, codes, and guidelines have a single-domain
  character, in that they address IEQ in terms of a number of isolated domains (i.e.,
  thermal, visual, acoustic, air quality). In this context, the present contribution
  explores the current state of multi-domain IEQ evaluation approaches and the necessary
  conditions for their further development and application. Toward this end, a number
  of common building rating schemes were selected and analyzed in detail. The results
  of this assessment imply the necessity of both short-term improvements of the existing
  schemes in terms of the transparency and plausibility of the applied point allocation
  and weighting strategies and the fundamental need for a deeper empirically grounded
  understanding of the nature of occupants’ perception of and behavior in the built
  environments.  '
