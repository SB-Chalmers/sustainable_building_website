abstract: 'Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is considered as the most suitable way to assess
  the environmental impact of buildings. Due to its extensiveness and complexity,
  but also due to a lack of knowledge amongst architects, the LCA methodology is currently
  most often applied as a post-design evaluation and not used to support or optimize
  design decisions during early design stages. Therefore, this paper looks at possible
  solutions to apply LCA, including operational energy demand simulation, in early
  design from two different perspectives: design-oriented user requirements, derived
  from literature, a survey, interviews and a focus group with architects, and LCA
  simplification strategies based on a literature review. Both perspectives are discussed
  and merged into an evaluation framework that can be used to check the suitability
  of LCA-based environmental impact assessment (EIA) tools for use by architects during
  early design stages, but also to develop new design-supportive LCA-based EIA tools.
  In turn, this can contribute to an increased uptake of these tools in building practice.'
