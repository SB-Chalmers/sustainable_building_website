abstract: 'In this study, an application of the adapted Co-Heating methodology for
  thermal performance evaluation of closed refrigerated display cabinets (RDCs) has
  been presented. A novel test series comprising three experiments has been developed
  and demonstrated on a commercial RDC with four doors to evaluate the envelope heat
  transfer coefficient, thermal inertia, infiltration at idle state and dynamic infiltration
  caused by door operations. The latter two experiments were conducted in parallel
  with the condensate collection method for validation of the results for infiltration.
  It was concluded with good (<10%) conformance between the methods that the infiltration
  at idle state for the tested RDC is approximately 0.022kg/s and that one 15s door
  opening causes approximately 0.94kg of ambient indoor air to infiltrate. Additionally,
  the time, equipment and associated costs for running the tests were compared, and
  it was concluded that the adapted Co-Heating methodology could substitute the condensate
  collection method for the evaluation of infiltration while providing additional
  results on the thermal performance.  '
