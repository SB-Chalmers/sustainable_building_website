abstract: 'The goal of this study was to identify drivers of environmental impact
  and quantify their influence on the environmental performance of wooden and massive
  residential and office buildings. We performed a life cycle assessment and used
  thermal simulation to quantify operational energy demand and to account for differences
  in thermal inertia of building mass. Twenty-eight input parameters, affecting operation,
  design, material, and exogenic building properties were sampled in a Monte Carlo
  analysis. To determine sensitivity, we calculated the correlation between each parameter
  and the resulting life cycle inventory and impact assessment scores. Parameters
  affecting operational energy demand and energy conversion are the most influential
  for the building’s total environmental performance. For climate change, electricity
  mix, ventilation rate, heating system, and construction material rank the highest.
  Thermal inertia results in an average 2-6% difference in heat demand. Non-renewable
  cumulative energy demand of wooden buildings is 18% lower, compared to a massive
  variant. Total cumulative energy demand is comparable. The median climate change
  impact is 25% lower, including end-of-life material credits and 22% lower, when
  credits are excluded. The findings are valid for small offices and residential buildings
  in Switzerland and regions with similar building culture, construction material
  production, and climate.  '
