abstract: "The primary goal of the built environment is to create the infrastructure\
  \ that facilitates the needs of the people that use them and elevate their quality\
  \ of life. Sustainable development has encouraged architects and urban planners\
  \ to be more sensitive toward the built environment's economic, environmental, and\
  \ social dimensions. Digital tools for performance assessment are commonly used\
  \ to shorten the feedback loop in testing designs for buildings and neighbourhoods.\
  \ However, these tools do not extend to the social dimension in the same way as\
  \ the economic and environmental dimensions. This thesis aims to contribute to USS\
  \ research and bridge the gap between theory and practice through digitalisation.\
  \ It investigates USS in general and explores how it can be conceptualised and made\
  \ operational to support architects and urban planners in their design process.\
  \ The focus is on digital tools and how they can be integrated into the current\
  \ architectural and urban design process. Two studies are carried out (A and B).\
  \ Based on systematic literature analysis, study A explores the theoretical background\
  \ of USS. It investigates the reasons for the lack of consensus on USS's conceptualisation\
  \ and how digital tools can be developed around these issues. Study B explores the\
  \ development of an indicator to support practitioners in evaluating the ability\
  \ of residents to achieve their daily needs and uses interviews with practitioners\
  \ for feedback on the indicator and how it can be improved. The findings indicate\
  \ that USS is a complex and often \\\"fuzzy\\\" topic. There are many definitions\
  \ for USS but little consensus among them. By viewing USS as an empty signifier,\
  \ stakeholders can collaboratively decide what social themes are important to them.\
  \ Two categories of social themes are identified - social equity and social capital.\
  \ Focusing on social and spatial equity, a USS indicator called Trip Completion\
  \ Rate is developed and used to explore the ability of residents to fulfil their\
  \ daily needs through examples. The interviews with practitioners suggest that an\
  \ indicator for evaluating social issues is appreciated, but further development\
  \ is required in communicating complex results to stakeholders. In conclusion, the\
  \ findings of this thesis contribute to a better understanding of USS and how to\
  \ operationalise it for architects and urban planners through indicators. To further\
  \ advance the integration of USS into the design process of neighbourhoods, digital\
  \ tools must focus on enhancing social equity in the built environment. Finally,\
  \ it identifies the indicators, methods and future pathways to advance the design\
  \ of socially sustainable neighbourhoods through digitalisation.  "
