abstract: 'Indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is a major domain of building conditions
  relating to occupant comfort, health and well-being. Especially in the office environment,
  IEQ can influence work productivity positively. Within the 17 UN Sustainable Development
  Goals (SDGs), goal 3 good health and well-being, and goal 8 decent work and economic
  growth are the two areas where IEQ can significantly contribute. To better design
  sustainable office buildings in line with the agenda 2030, the study aims to examine
  occupant satisfaction, health and work in a newly renovated office building which
  is labelled by the BREEAM certification scheme Silver. Occupant preferences of IEQ
  comparing to the current conditions were also explored to provide advice for future
  design. The results show that occupant satisfaction with IEQ has not well achieved
  and in the office environment occupants prefer warmer temperature, more fresh air,
  less noise, and more daylight. We also find that perceived IEQ is extensively related
  to occupant health and work productivity. It concludes that in such a newly renovated
  office building as a high-performance building, there are still many problems from
  the indoor environments. Therefore, improvements are needed to gain occupant satisfaction
  and positively influence occupant health, well-being and work productivity.  '
