abstract: Limited by the working temperature of the test equipment, most of high-precision
  surface figure measurement techniques cannot be put into application under a cryogenic
  environment. This paper reports the first attempt to measure the surface figure
  of a high-precision terahertz reflector panel under low temperatures based on photogrammetry.
  The measurement employs a high-resolution industrial camera sitting on the automatic
  testing platform which enables photos been taken in an automatic fashion inside
  a climate chamber. A repeatable accuracy of 2.1 μm (rms) is achieved under the cryogenic
  environment. Furthermore, the surface figure measured by a three-coordinate measuring
  machine under the room temperature is used to calibrate the thickness differences
  of the targets. By this technique, the surface figure of an aluminum prototype panel
  of the 5 meter Dome A Terahertz Telescope (DATE5) is measured from room temperature
  down to −55°C to obtain the rule of variation of surface deformation of the panel
  under low temperatures. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.
