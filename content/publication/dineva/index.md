abstract: 'The goal of significantly increasing the energetic performance of multifamily
  buildings through effective retrofit measures has been proven to be feasible in
  three pilot sites in the Netherlands, Sweden and France in the BEEM-UP project.
  Further development of the project would naturally be to seek ways towards implementation
  of the gained experience on an even bigger scale, namely Eastern European countries
  with a large energetic refurbishment potential. However, the European Union comprises
  of countries of various stages of economic development, social-cultural values and
  environmental framework conditions so that the strategies discovered need to be
  translated to the specific national context. The goal of this paper is to evaluate
  seven countries from Eastern Europe by collecting and condensing information to
  great levels of abstraction, divided into seven major categories. The paper concludes
  on the major barriers towards energy efficiency and proposed a concrete strategy
  on how to overcome them.  '
