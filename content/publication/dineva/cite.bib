 abstract = {The goal of significantly increasing the energetic performance of multifamily buildings through effective retrofit measures has been proven to be feasible in three pilot sites in the Netherlands, Sweden and France in the BEEM-UP project. Further development of the project would naturally be to seek ways towards implementation of the gained experience on an even bigger scale, namely Eastern European countries with a large energetic refurbishment potential. However, the European Union comprises of countries of various stages of economic development, social-cultural values and environmental framework conditions so that the strategies discovered need to be translated to the specific national context. The goal of this paper is to evaluate seven countries from Eastern Europe by collecting and condensing information to great levels of abstraction, divided into seven major categories. The paper concludes on the major barriers towards energy efficiency and proposed a concrete strategy on how to overcome them.  },
