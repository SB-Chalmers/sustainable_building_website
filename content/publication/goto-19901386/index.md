abstract: Interpolation techniques for the magnitude-mode discrete Fourier transformed
  (DFT) spectra of exponentially damped sinusoids have been developed. However, simple
  formulas to interpolate the apodized DFT spectra have not been given, except those
  used to interpolate the Hanning-apodized spectra. In this paper, we derive simple
  interpolation formulas using the sine-bell and rectangle windows. It is found that
  the formulas for the rectangle window are essentially identical to Lorentzian interpolation.
  Furthermore, we derive generalized formulas to interpolate DFT spectra apodized
  by a family of sinα(X) windows, which includes the rectangle, sine-bell, and Hanning
  windows. We call the proposed interpolation 'generalized' because any integer value
  of α can be used. Simulation results show that the accuracy of interpolation is
  improved remarkably with increases in the value of the parameter α.
