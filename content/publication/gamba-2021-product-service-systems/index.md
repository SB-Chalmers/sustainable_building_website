abstract: "The building use stage offers the opportunity to provide valuable and sustainable\
  \ product-service systems (PSS) that enhance the buildings' value for the end-users.\
  \ Many of them are delivered by networks of stakeholders that actively involve small\
  \ andmedium enterprises (SMEs). We have combined an existing literature review with\
  \ the multiple stakeholders' feedback to identify several problems and define the\
  \ main hypothesis: diverse and presented in a structural way information about PSS\
  \ can contribute to a better understanding of the added value by multiple stakeholders.\
  \ We have co-created a list of criteria, which were formed into the sustainability\
  \ multi-criteria framework. The proposed framework also supplements PSS-specific\
  \ criteria, such as PSS type, PSS collaborative partnership networks type, and PSS\
  \ integration type. A list of findings related to the topic was declared to help\
  \ further develop the study, such as the correlations between PSS-related and PSS\
  \ sustainability-oriented criteria.  "
