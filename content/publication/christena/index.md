abstract: 'There is an increasing desire by managers to reduce the amount of energy
  consumed by the buildings in their portfolio. Energy efficiency measures on existing
  buildings, however, are often economically feasible only if executed at the same
  time as the execution of necessary maintenance and refurbishment measures. At the
  strategic level it would be useful to be able to better plan the costs and benefits
  of energy efficiency measures so that decisions could be made to execute them when
  the opportunity arises.In this paper, a Cost-Performance-Indicator (CPI) curve is
  proposed to indicate additional costs and benefits of energy efficiency measures
  at a strategic level, and evidence is given that corroborates the hypothesis that
  energy efficiency measures follow the law of increasing relative costs. The usefulness
  of the CPI curve is demonstrated through two case studies. An example is provided
  and the potential is discussed for using this curve for the planning and budgeting
  of refurbishment and energy efficiency measures, and as a tool to explain the relation
  between costs and benefits of measures enhancing building energy efficiency, including
  the production of renewable energy, to investors.  '
