abstract: "Recognizing the value of open-source research databases in advancing the\
  \ art and science of HVAC, in 2014 the ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II\
  \ project was launched under the leadership of University of California at Berkeley's\
  \ Center for the Built Environment and The University of Sydney's Indoor Environmental\
  \ Quality (IEQ) Laboratory. The exercise began with a systematic collection and\
  \ harmonization of raw data from the last two decades of thermal comfort field studies\
  \ around the world. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II (Comfort Database),\
  \ now an online, open-source database, includes approximately 81,846 complete sets\
  \ of objective indoor climatic observations with accompanying “right-here-right-now”\
  \ subjective evaluations by the building occupants who were exposed to them. The\
  \ database is intended to support diverse inquiries about thermal comfort in field\
  \ settings. A simple web-based interface to the database enables filtering on multiple\
  \ criteria, including building typology, occupancy type, subjects' demographic variables,\
  \ subjective thermal comfort states, indoor thermal environmental criteria, calculated\
  \ comfort indices, environmental control criteria and outdoor meteorological information.\
  \ Furthermore, a web-based interactive thermal comfort visualization tool has been\
  \ developed that allows end-users to quickly and interactively explore the data.\
