abstract: The energy consumption of the residential sector has been increasing and
  the formconditions have been suggested as one of the critical aspects in the environmental
  behavior of dwellings. In centralsouth Chile, there is a predominance of single-family
  housing with independent volumetrics, which may have a considerable effect on their
  energy performance. In order to clarify the effect of formal characteristics on
  the environmental behavior of this typology, the paper reviewsseveral studies and
  the main conditions of dwellings in the area, followed by an analysis based on energy
  simulations of a model with different configurations with the same surface and constructional
  properties. The analysis results enable the identification of an important influence
  on the variation, contiguity and height of energy demand, with low impact of solar
  orientation. The conclusions suggest a regulatory factor corresponding to the surface
  of exposed walls, which is expressed on their formal and material importance; such
  a factor may be implemented to promote the energy consumption reduction and the
  environmental improvement of dwellings in the area.
