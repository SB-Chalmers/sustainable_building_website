abstract: Current and future aircraft engines are increasingly relying upon the use
  of multivariable control approach for meeting advanced performance requirements.
  A multivariable adaptive control (MRAC) scheme is proposed in this paper. The adaptation
  law is derived using only input and output (I/O) measurements. Simulation studies
  are performed for a two - spool turbojet engine. The satisfactory transient responses
  are obtained at different operating points from idle to maximum dry power within
  the flight envelope. These show insensitivity of the design to engine power level
  and flight condition. Simulation results also show high effectiveness of reducing
  interaction in multivariable systems with significant coupling. Using the multivariable
  MRAC controller, the engine acceleration time is reduced by about 19 percent in
  comparison with the conventional engine controller.
