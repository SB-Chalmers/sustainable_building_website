 abstract = {Current and future aircraft engines are increasingly relying upon the use of multivariable control approach for meeting advanced performance requirements. A multivariable adaptive control (MRAC) scheme is proposed in this paper. The adaptation law is derived using only input and output (I/O) measurements. Simulation studies are performed for a two - spool turbojet engine. The satisfactory transient responses are obtained at different operating points from idle to maximum dry power within the flight envelope. These show insensitivity of the design to engine power level and flight condition. Simulation results also show high effectiveness of reducing interaction in multivariable systems with significant coupling. Using the multivariable MRAC controller, the engine acceleration time is reduced by about 19 percent in comparison with the conventional engine controller.},
