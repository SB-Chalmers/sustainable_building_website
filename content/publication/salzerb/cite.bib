 abstract = {The use of round bamboo as load bearing member for low-rise housing is an interesting alternative construction method for tropical regions. Similar to timber engineering, a predictable fire resistance is a requirement for its legal approval and application at scale. The research presents fire test results on selected bamboo-based construction systems developed in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Tests were conducted in Indonesia according to the National Standard SNI 1741, which is referring to ISO 834-1 and JIS A 1304. Different bamboo wall cross-sections were tested in specimens of 1050mm by 1050mm and evaluated according to insulation, integrity and mechanical resistance criteria. All specimens received a rating of 60 minutes resistance. The research provided a general understanding of the system response and highlighted critical variables of the wall system, which can be transformed into design recommendations.  },
