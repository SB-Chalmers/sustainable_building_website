 abstract = {Compared to autonomous navigation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation based on inter-satellite link only, a method for autonomous navigation of LEO constellation combining inter-satellite link and geomagnetic measurement is proposed to solve the problem about overall rotation and drifting of LEO constellation. The absolute property of geomagnetic field is fully utilized. Spatial reference information is provided for LEO constellation by obtaining and analyzing the angular distance between the line-of-sight vectors of adjacent satellites in the same orbit of the LEO constellation, as well as the direction and module value of geomagnetic field. After non -rank deficient analysis, the state equation and measurement equation are established. The optimal estimation about the whole state of LEO constellation can be realized using Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF). The simulation results demonstrate that the position error is less than 20 m and velocity error is less than 0.05 mâ€¢s -1. The autonomous navigation of LEO constellation can last 180days, which meets the application requirements. Copyright © 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).},
