abstract: Compared to autonomous navigation of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation
  based on inter-satellite link only, a method for autonomous navigation of LEO constellation
  combining inter-satellite link and geomagnetic measurement is proposed to solve
  the problem about overall rotation and drifting of LEO constellation. The absolute
  property of geomagnetic field is fully utilized. Spatial reference information is
  provided for LEO constellation by obtaining and analyzing the angular distance between
  the line-of-sight vectors of adjacent satellites in the same orbit of the LEO constellation,
  as well as the direction and module value of geomagnetic field. After non -rank
  deficient analysis, the state equation and measurement equation are established.
  The optimal estimation about the whole state of LEO constellation can be realized
  using Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF). The simulation results demonstrate that the
  position error is less than 20 m and velocity error is less than 0.05 mâ€¢s -1.
  The autonomous navigation of LEO constellation can last 180days, which meets the
  application requirements. Copyright © 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation
