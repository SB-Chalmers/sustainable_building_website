abstract: 'Abstract The EU directive to create Energy Performance Certificates (EPC)
  for all buildings was implemented in Sweden as a tool to advise building owners
  on possible improvements and to give energy efficiency visible market value. The
  Swedish EPCs include measured energy usage. Currently 82% of the buildings have
  EPCs; this database makes it possible to create overview and to validate models
  of the building stock in an unprecedented high detail. However, the process of issuing
  Swedish EPCs has received criticism from real estate agents, real estate owners,
  Energy Experts, and Boverket, the national agency responsible for EPC data collection.
  In order to use the EPC data for describing the building stock it is necessary to
  assess and remediate the data quality. This has been done by merging the EPC data
  with databases of the Housing and Urban Development office and one of the larger
  real estate companies in Sweden, Riksbyggen. The Swedish EPC specific area measurement,
  Atemp, is found to vary according to methods of derivation. The method of estimating
  Atemp is improved using a stepwise regression model (R2 = 0.979). This method can
  be applied to subsets of EPCs depending on the intended way of describing the building
  stock.  '
