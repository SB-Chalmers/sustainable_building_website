abstract: 'In Switzerland, the advantages of timber buildings for the climate are
  broadly discussed. In the following paper, a comparative sustainability assessment
  of four building alternatives is presented. Especially the contribution of implementing
  Swiss timber versus the implementation of imported timber is highlighted. Additionally,
  the timber-hybrid building structures are compared to a pure reinforced concrete
  structure. The timber-hybrid structure, with Swiss timber, has clear ecological
  advantages with only half the greenhouse gas emissions and half the non-renewable
  energy consumption compared to the reinforced concrete alternative. Comparing the
  Swiss timber alternative to the imported timber alternative, there are clear ecological
  advantages, as well. In terms of economic and social sustainability assessment criteria,
  the reinforced concrete alternative has the lowest production costs and the lowest
  labor intensity (measured in terms of full-time equivalents). Additionally, the
  paper includes an analysis of biogenic CO2 emissions and CO2 storage within the
  timber building alternatives. Finally, an up-scaling to the national level is attempted,
  showcasing the ecological and economic advantages of promoting the use of locally
  produced timber.  '
