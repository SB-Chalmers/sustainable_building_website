abstract: 'The purpose of this study is to synthesize the widely used theories about
  co-creation from two main perspectives: co-creation as an innovation process and
  co-creation as a design process applied to the service concept design in the built
  environment context. The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry
  do not have much application of end-user-oriented service design in general, especially
  with intensive co-creation processes. To facilitate such a process, we are using
  a living lab environment as a laboratorial model of the real built environment,
  but with the opportunity to have access to the end-users and different types of
  stakeholders. Using the KTH Live-in-Lab explorative case study, we were able to
  discuss the concept of co-creation by distinguishing between co-creation as innovation
  and co-creation as a design process, facilitating the process of co-creation of
  service concepts for the proposed built environment including methods from both
  perspectives: innovation and design, and evaluating the process of service concepts
  co-creation for the built environment from the point of innovation, knowledge transfer,
  sustainability, and user experience.  '
