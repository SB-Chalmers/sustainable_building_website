abstract: In an attempt to design antitumour cyclophosphazenes of improved specificity
  by linking them to some natural tumour finders, we studied the binding of gem-N3P3Az4Cl2
  to spermine. Synthesis, NMR and mass spectra of the vectorized drug (in which two
  N3P3Az4 active principles are linked to spermine in a DISPIROBINO configuration)
  are described. Results obtained with this compound in 6 murine tumour systems (L1210
  and P388 leukaemias, 3LL carcinoma, M5076 reticulum cell sarcoma, B16 melanoma and
  line 16 mammary carcinoma), are also described and compared with results previously
  obtained about the targeting of gem-N3P3Az4Cl2 through 1,3-diaminopropane and 1,4-diaminobutane
  (putrescine). Â© 1986.
