abstract: "Buildings are responsible for 38% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\
  \ and, therefore, pathways to reduce their impact are crucial to achieve climate\
  \ targets. Building stock energy models (BSEMs) have long been used as a tool to\
  \ assess the current and future energy demand and environmental impact of building\
  \ stocks. BSEMs have become more and more complex and are often tailored to case-specific\
  \ datasets, which results in a high degree of heterogeneity among models. This heterogeneity,\
  \ together with a lack of consistency in the reporting hinders the understanding\
  \ of these models and, thereby, an accurate interpretation and comparison of results.\
  \ In this paper we present a reporting guideline in order to improve reporting practices\
  \ of BSEMs. The guideline was developed by experts as part of the IEA's Annex 70\
  \ and builds upon reporting guidelines from other fields. It consists of five topics\
  \ (Overview, Model Components, Input and Output, Quality Assurance and Additional\
  \ Information), which are further subdivided into subtopics. We explain which model\
  \ aspects should be described in each subtopic, and provide illustrative examples\
  \ on how to apply the guideline. The reporting guideline is consistent with the\
  \ model classification framework and online model registry also developed in the\
  \ Annex.  "
