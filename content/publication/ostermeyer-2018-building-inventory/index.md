abstract: 'Material usage and the related embodied environmental impact have grown
  in significance in the built environment. Therefore, cities and governments need
  to develop strategies to reduce both the consumption of resources during usage phase
  as well as the embodied impact of the current building stock. This article proposes
  a new component-based building inventory database as a basis to develop such strategies
  using building stock modeling. The developed database clusters the building stock
  according to building typology (single- family houses, multifamily houses, and office
  buildings), age, and the main construction systems of the different building components.
  Based on the component makeup, it lists the necessary material input and waste output
  for different refurbishment options for each building component. The advantages
  of the proposed database structure are shown based on two applications for the developed
  database for Switzerland. The component- based database allows optimization of refurbishment
  strategies not only from an energetic perspective, but also with respect to materials,
  both on the input (sourcing of materials) and the output (waste streams) level.
  The database structure makes it possible to continuously extend the data set by
  adding new refurbishment options or add data such as component- specific lifetimes,
  costs, or labor intensities of the refurbishment options. In combination with an
  aligned economic model, this would give an even more holistic view, impact, and
  feasibility of different refurbishment scenarios both in environmental and economic
  terms. Introduction  '
