abstract: 'The purpose of the Spaces Project is to investigate glazed spaces in residential
  buildings from both a building physical and architectural point of view and to provide
  descriptions of how they work, with regard to thermal comfort and to social aspects.
  This has resulted in tools for the design of glazed spaces that take into account
  the social aspects and the thermal comfort. A challenge for the architect is to
  determine and describe the geometry of the glazed space, which materials make up
  the connecting surfaces and what properties the surrounding glass surfaces should
  have. With very little time, it is desirable in the design phase to get clear indications
  of temperature conditions in the glazed space, in particular how high the temperatures
  will become in summertime. The Spaces project began with a literature study on glazed
  spaces, dealing with geometry of the spaces, glazing, ​​usage, thermal comfort,
  ventilation, energy, social aspects and cultivation. Subsequently, eight relevant
  buildings were identified, called case studies, which were examined in detail during
  study visits and with the help of drawings and measurements of temperature and daylight.
  The buildings are located in Malmö, Eslöv, Gothenburg, Stockholm, Umeå and on Hönö.
  For all case studies, interviews have been conducted with residents and with professionals
  such as consultants, managers, architects, project managers, about the glazed space
  and how it works, mainly with regard to social sustainability but also technical
  functions. The residents have also responded to a survey and rated qualities in
  the areas of thermal comfort for different seasons, air quality, daylight, social
  activities and relaxation. With the help of the material from this part of the project,
  a checklist for the design of atriums has been produced which, for example, includes
  social activities, visibility, furnishability. In order to assess thermal comfort,
  an excel-based calculation tool, Spaces Calculator, for calculating temperatures
  in glazed spaces was created. The calculation model was designed so that architects,
  during the design stage, have access to a tool that is easy to start using, and
  where parameters can be varied quickly (e.g. geometries, glazing and materials),
  since in the design stage is desirable to be able to investigate many alternatives.
  The results from Spaces Calculator have been compared with results from the building
  simulation program IDA ICE, and user-friendliness has been tested by architects.
  Manual for Spaces Calculator and a number of examples of thermal variations when
  you change parameters for a building are produced. These examples show, for example,
  that a taller building reduces problems with overtemperatures in the summer, that
  heavier surface materials (with higher heat storage capacity) facing the glazed
  space dampen temperature fluctuations and how much a reduced g-value on skylights
  can reduce overtemperatures.   To sum up, there are four main outcomes of the Spaces
  project; the literature survey, the case studies with interviews, the calculation
  tool Spaces Calculator with parameter studies, and the design checklist.  '
