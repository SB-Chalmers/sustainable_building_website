abstract: "Su, R., Munns, K., Beauchemin, K. A., Schwartzkopf-Genswein, K., Jin-Quan,\
  \ L., Topp, E. and Sharma, R. 2011. Effect of backgrounding and transition diets\
  \ on fecal concentration and strain types of commensal Escherichia coli in beef\
  \ cattle. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 91: 449-458. The aim of the study was to assess the\
  \ effect of four different backgrounding diets [55% corn silage in combination with\
  \ 40% of either temper rolled barley-grain, wheat dried distillers' grain, corn\
  \ dried distillers' grain or millrun (dry matter basis)] and a transition diet containing\
  \ increasing amount of concentrate (60 to 90%) on fecal Escherichia coli in feedlot\
  \ heifers. Heifers were fed backgrounding forage based diets for 91 d and then were\
  \ shifted to a transition diet for an additional 18 d. Strain characterization of\
  \ E. coli (n=224) was carried out at time time points over 109 d and indicated that\
  \ heifers fed the barley-grain diet shed higher (P&lt;0.001) total and tetracycline-resistant\
  \ (Tetr) E. coli in the backgrounding phase. Of the total E. coli examined (n=224),\
  \ 70.3% showed resistance to one or more of the 14 antimicrobials examined, which\
  \ increased to 82.3% by day 109. Among the recovered E. coli, 23 phenotypes and\
  \ 154 pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns grouped into 38 clusters indicative\
  \ of extensive E. coli diversity in heifers. Although supplementation of 40% barley-grain\
  \ was correlated to higher total E. coli shedding in the backgrounding phase, the\
  \ backgrounding diets did not influence strain clustering. Strains collected during\
  \ the transition phase clustered more closely than those collected during the backgrounding\
  \ phase. This increased strain clustering with high concentrate inclusion in the\
  \ transition diet was observed within 18 d of the transition phase. Our study indicated\
  \ variations in E. coli shedding rates and strain clustering in relation to time\
  \ and diet."
