abstract: 'This report aims to expand on existing logic and knowledge of Living Labs
  and take into consideration the innovation ecosystems surrounding Living Labs. 
  Through literature review and the lessons learned from the initiation and implementation
  of two Living Lab infrastructures in the Building Technology Accelerator Flagship
  Program (BTA), perspectives are offered focusing on Open Innovation ecosystems,
  Open Innovation organizational elements, co-creation and data system tools.  The
  breakdown of the methods as well as the results derived have been synthesized and
  compiled in this report. Key lessons learned were summarized and categorized using
  the European Network of Living Labs (ENoLL) harmonization Cube. This was done to
  provide a more comprehensive set of suggestions for organizations connected to Living
  Labs transitioning towards Open Innovation and developing Next Generation Living
  Labs. We hope This report is a start towards the development of a comprehensive
  methodology for Living Lab infrastructures within the BTA network and points to
  important elements for this development.  '
