 abstract = {To improve employees’ comfort, health and productivity, indoor environmental quality (IEQ) is one of the most significant aspects of concern in the workplace. In future office buildings, IEQ is not only to meet the basic requirement of hygiene and physiological needs but also to motivate and lift occupants’ satisfaction. This chapter will introduce the attractive quality theory as well as the Kano model and its application in the field of indoor environment science on occupant satisfaction with IEQ and the research methods at workplaces. The chapter will also discuss the limitation of the theory and future research needs to utilise and verify the Kano model.  },
