 abstract = {Living Labs are fast emerging instruments for advancing user-centred innovations in various areas of human activities.Due to their large diversity in terms of thematic approaches, constellations, practices, outcomes and longevity, variousmethodologies have been proposed to describe and link living labs in a consistent way. The theory has so far seen fewapplications. The strength of the present work is that it uses an existing and comprehensive methodology, entitled LivingLabs Harmonization Cube (LLHC), on a concrete and relevant example – HSB Living Lab. The characterization of HSBLiving Lab by LLHC is based on the authors' personal experience in the design, management and operation of this livinglab for the last three years, which is supported by examples. The results show that HSB Living Lab has not yet reachedfull maturity in any of the six categories included in LLHC and identifies areas for future development.  },
