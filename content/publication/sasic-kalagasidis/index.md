abstract: "Living Labs are fast emerging instruments for advancing user-centred innovations\
  \ in various areas of human activities.Due to their large diversity in terms of\
  \ thematic approaches, constellations, practices, outcomes and longevity, variousmethodologies\
  \ have been proposed to describe and link living labs in a consistent way. The theory\
  \ has so far seen fewapplications. The strength of the present work is that it uses\
  \ an existing and comprehensive methodology, entitled LivingLabs Harmonization Cube\
  \ (LLHC), on a concrete and relevant example – HSB Living Lab. The characterization\
  \ of HSBLiving Lab by LLHC is based on the authors' personal experience in the design,\
  \ management and operation of this livinglab for the last three years, which is\
  \ supported by examples. The results show that HSB Living Lab has not yet reachedfull\
  \ maturity in any of the six categories included in LLHC and identifies areas for\
  \ future development.  "
