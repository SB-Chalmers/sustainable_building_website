abstract: "With regard to residential energy use in the European Union (EU), most\
  \ studies consider potential adopters of the technology (e.g., private owners) as\
  \ being the sole decision-makers in the technology selection. However, during an\
  \ integrated decision-making process (e.g., a construction project) multiple stakeholders\
  \ will interact, influencing each other's judgement, thereby making it difficult\
  \ to discern who is affecting the final decision, and to what extent. The goal of\
  \ this study is to outline the full network of stakeholders involved in the decision-making\
  \ process, along with their degree of power and interaction in the technology choice.\
  \ For this purpose, empirical evidence from a multi-country survey is examined using\
  \ social network analysis (SNA). The information is compared across building typologies,\
  \ project types and countries (i.e., Italy, Spain, Germany, Poland, the United Kingdom,\
  \ France, Belgium and the Netherlands). The results demonstrate that, in EU residential\
  \ buildings, potential adopters of the technology are not the only stakeholders\
  \ involved in the technology selection. They are in all instances in communication\
  \ with multiple stakeholders, some of whom also hold a high level of power in the\
  \ decision (i.e., key persuaders). Furthermore, their level of power and communication\
  \ varies substantially across building typologies, project types and countries.\
