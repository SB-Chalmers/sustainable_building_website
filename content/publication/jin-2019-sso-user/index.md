abstract: 'Users have significant impacts on building energy consumption and can interact
  with indoor environments. Identifying user needs, behaviour, and preference is crucial
  for the design of both new and the renovation of existing buildings. Offices are
  important since people spend on average one-third of their life at work. It also
  accounted for a larger share of the energy use and the floor area of non-residential
  buildings in Europe. Moreover, more ambitious regulations and the increasing popularity
  of voluntary building certification schemes require the construction of more energy-efficient
  buildings, but in reality, a ‘performance gap’ is often observed. Therefore, deep
  insights in user perceptions and experiences can provide the knowledge basis for
  developing a new generation of office buildings that provide a healthier and more
  productive indoor environment guided by a user-centric approach. In  his article,
  we will introduce the web-based application of the Questionnaire and Diary Apps
  and a Virtual Reality (VR) design tool developed to support the interactive co-creation
  session with users and designers.  '
