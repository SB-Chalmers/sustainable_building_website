abstract: 'In this study, a top-down method for constructing databases of industrial
  waste generation profiles is presented. The method employs routinely reported statistical
  data for economic activities, which enables simple data acquisition and ensures
  capture of changes in production processes and waste generation. Quantified waste
  generation profiles following the EWC-stat nomenclature for 42 waste types were
  compiled into two EU databases, one for 12 sectors and the other for more than 200
  industries. These were complimented with quantified factors on waste generation
  per employee for each sector. The relationship between amounts of waste generated
  and number of employees has been confirmed for each sector with statistical tests;
  this can be used to estimate waste quantities in other scenarios. The databases
  employ standard EU economic and waste nomenclatures, which are also similar to those
  used worldwide. Potential use scenarios include: evaluation of different geographic
  boundaries, such as industrial park, municipal, regional or national level; focus
  on expected types and quantities of waste generated by particular sectors and industries;
  or targeting particular types of wastes, the economic activities that produce them
  and the quantities generated. The latter scenario is illustrated in this paper by
  exploring potential for industrial symbiosis where waste streams from bio-based
  industries are used to produce biogas in the Västra Götaland region of Sweden. The
  developed method and databases could support the implementation of circular economy
  policies, including industrial symbiosis.  '
