 abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has hugely affected our lives, including the daily work of university students and teachers, although such difficulties can emerge as drivers for change to discover new pedagogical possibilities. This paper explores this challenge in the context of the Design and Planning for Social Inclusion master's course within architecture, at Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden). It examines the pedagogical and societal contribution arising from a systematic use of a digital whiteboard as a collaborative tool, following an interlinked process of co-creation in which stakeholders and students interact continuously to co-create architectural and urban design proposals. Results of such an innovative process can be used to revisit the impact of Covid-19 on students' work and highlight positive and unexpected discoveries, and at the same time integrate feedback from local community and stakeholders, contributing to societal outreach and architectural practice.  },
