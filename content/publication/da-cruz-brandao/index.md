abstract: "The Covid-19 pandemic has hugely affected our lives, including the daily\
  \ work of university students and teachers, although such difficulties can emerge\
  \ as drivers for change to discover new pedagogical possibilities. This paper explores\
  \ this challenge in the context of the Design and Planning for Social Inclusion\
  \ master's course within architecture, at Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden).\
  \ It examines the pedagogical and societal contribution arising from a systematic\
  \ use of a digital whiteboard as a collaborative tool, following an interlinked\
  \ process of co-creation in which stakeholders and students interact continuously\
  \ to co-create architectural and urban design proposals. Results of such an innovative\
  \ process can be used to revisit the impact of Covid-19 on students' work and highlight\
  \ positive and unexpected discoveries, and at the same time integrate feedback from\
  \ local community and stakeholders, contributing to societal outreach and architectural\
  \ practice.  "
