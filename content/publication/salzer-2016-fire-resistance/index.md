abstract: 'The use of round bamboo as load bearing member for low-rise housing is
  an interesting alternative construction method for tropical regions. Similar to
  timber engineering, a predictable fire resistance is a requirement for its legal
  approval and application at scale. The research presents fire test results on selected
  bamboo-based construction systems developed in Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Tests
  were conducted in Indonesia according to the National Standard SNI 1741, which is
  referring to ISO 834-1 and JIS A 1304. Different bamboo wall cross-sections were
  tested in specimens of 1050mm by 1050mm and evaluated according to insulation, integrity
  and mechanical resistance criteria. All specimens received a rating of 60 minutes
  resistance. The research provided a general understanding of the system response
  and highlighted critical variables of the wall system, which can be transformed
  into design recommendations.  '
