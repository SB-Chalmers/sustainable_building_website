abstract: 'Purpose Within the field of life cycle assessment (LCA), simplifications
  are a response to the practical restrictions in the context of a study. In the 1990s,
  simplifications were part of a debate on streamlining within LCA. Since then, many
  studies have been published on simplifying LCA but with little attention to systematise
  the approaches available. Also, despite being pervasive during the making of LCA
  studies, simplifications remain often invisible in the final results. This paper
  therefore reviews the literature on simplification in LCA in order to systematise
  the approaches found today. Methods A review of the LCA simplification literature
  was conducted. The systematic search and selection process led to a sample of 166
  publications. During the review phase, the conceptual contributions to the simplification
  discourse were evaluated. A dataset of 163 entries was created, listing the conceptual
  contributions to the simplification debate. An empirically grounded analysis led
  to the generative development of a systematisation of simplifications according
  to their underlying simplifying logic. Results and discussion Five simplifying logics
  were identified: exclusion, inventory data substitution, qualitative expert judgment,
  standardisation and automation. Together, these simplifying logics inform 13 simplification
  strategies. The identified logics represent approaches to handle the complexities
  of product systems and expectations of the users of LCA results with the resources
  available to the analyst. Each simplification strategy is discussed with regard
  to its main applications and challenges. Conclusions This paper provides a first
  systematisation of the different simplification logics frequently applied in LCA
  since the original streamlining discussion. The presented terminology can help making
  communication about simplification more explicit and transparent, thus important
  for the credibility of LCA. Despite the pervasiveness of simplification in LCA,
  there is a relative lack of research on simplification per se, making further research
  describing simplification as a practice and analysing simplifications methodologically
  desirable.  '
