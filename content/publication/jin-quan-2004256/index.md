abstract: To obtain boron carbide nanowire, the mixture of carbon nanotubes and boron
  powder is heated to 1000-1100Â°C for 30-60 min. The results of transmission electronic
  microscopy examination show that most of the carbon nanotube in our sample transfer
  into straight boron carbide nanowire. The structure of the nanowire is studied by
  the selected area electronic diffraction (SAED) and HRTEM, which shows that most
  of the nanowire is B 4C nanowire. There is a nickel particle at the end of some
  boron carbide nanowires. The nickel particles come from the catalyst encapsulated
  in the hollow of the carbon nanotube. The growing mechanism of the boron carbide
  nanowire is discussed. Carbon nanotube acts as template for the growth of boron
  carbide nanowire. During the reaction, boron atoms replace some sites of the carbon
  in the nanotube, resulting in reconstructing the crystal of the nanotube and mending
  the defects in the carbon nanotube.
