abstract: 'In the built environment, digital tools for performance assessment considerably
  shorten the feedback loop in an iterative design process. However, these digital
  tools focus on the economic and environmental dimensions and do not extend to the
  social dimension in the same way. Our research aims to develop digital tools to
  integrate Social Sustainability in the digital design process on the neighbourhood
  level. In this project, we evaluate academic literature on Social Sustainability
  through Conceptual framework analysis. First, we map the data sources and categorize
  them. Second, we identify and name the concepts found in the search. Third, we deconstruct
  and re-categorize the concepts. Finally, we integrate the concepts to form the theoretical
  basis of our solution. We find that the contributing factors that create contention
  in discussing social sustainability are both intrinsic and extrinsic to Social Sustainability.
  There is a disconnect between the theory and policy recommendations of social sustainability
  in the built environment. The practical challenges for the development of a digital
  design tool are primarily in resolving differences in stakeholder value systems
  and subsequently the priorities of social issues to stakeholders, and the technical
  issues we observe are on the quantification of qualitative indicators of social
  sustainability and availability of data. Drawing from these results, we propose
  guidelines for the development of digital tools for architects and planners working
  to promote social sustainability on a neighbourhood scale.  '
