abstract: 'Various environmental and regulatory changes, such as climate change mitigation
  strategies and market regulation, have increased the complexity of the challenges
  which cities, utilities, and real estate owners face. Thus, cities and their utilities
  are confronted with various problems: How, and at which costs can ambitious climate
  change mitigation goals be reached? How can urban planning be developed while simultaneously
  tackling climate change? How can the long-term economic and environmental performance
  of the building stock be optimized? How to plan electricity, gas, and thermal networks
  to suit future energy demand and the existing urban topology? These problems are
  usually addressed individually and independently from each other using instruments
  that lack an interdisciplinary approach. Data collections are often done “ad hoc”
  and not from a systemic point of view, resulting in datasets that are often incomplete,
  incoherent, and with different structures that make them difficult to merge. The
  paper describes the Carbon Resource Energy and Adaption Toolbox Europe (CREATE),
  a comprehensive modelling and data toolbox that can overcome these shortcomings.
  This toolbox has been developed to include elements that are specially conceived
  for various use cases of different decision makers (and their service providers):
  urban planners, energy utilities, network operators, building portfolio owners,
  building code designers, construction authorities, energy and climate policy makers.
  CREATE has three main elements: • Expert BSM: GIS-based scenario analysis tool for
  urban and utility energy planners, providing evaluation and management of energy
  demand, emissions, renewable energy resources, and other parameters. • Basic Web
  BSM: Simplified web-based spatial data information, monitoring and visualization
  tool for smaller municipalities and utilities. • Portfolio BSM: A portfolio assessment
  tool for real estate portfolio owners and manager to analyse the status quo of their
  portfolio and the possibility to develop short- and long-term strategies in terms
  of economic, energy and carbon performance. As such CREATE enables engagement between
  the various decision-making levels and bodies of cities and municipalities as well
  as (energy) utilities and building portfolio owners or real estate site developers.  '
