abstract: "[Abstract] The immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a newly recognized\
  \ systemic autoimmune disease characterized by diffuse inflammatory cell infiltration\
  \ and/or organ enlargement in one or more organ foci and elevated serum IgG4 levels.\
  \ Typical histopathological changes include lymphocytic cell infiltration, schlieren\
  \ interstitial fibrosis, and/or occlusive phlebitis. The incidence of IgG4-RD is\
  \ low, very heterogeneous, and similar to many other diseases in clinical, pathological\
  \ and laboratory examination, so delayed diagnosis and misdiagnosis are very common.\
  \ The early diagnosis and differential diagnosis of IgG4-RD have been reviewed in\
  \ present paper, especially IgG4-related hepatobiliary diseases, IgG4-related skin\
  \ lesions, Mikulic disease and autoimmune pancreatitis, in order to reduce misdiagnosis.\
