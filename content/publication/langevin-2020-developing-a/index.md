abstract: "Buildings contribute 40% of global greenhouse gas emissions; therefore,\
  \ strategies that can substantially reduce emissions from the building stock are\
  \ key components of broader efforts to mitigate climate change and achieve sustainable\
  \ development goals. Models that represent the energy use of the building stock\
  \ at scale under various scenarios of technology deployment have become essential\
  \ tools for the development and assessment of such strategies. Within the past decade,\
  \ the capabilities of building stock energy models have improved considerably, while\
  \ model transferability and sharing has increased. Given these advancements, a new\
  \ scheme for classifying building stock energy models is needed to facilitate communication\
  \ of modeling approaches and the handling of important model dimensions. In this\
  \ article, we present a new building stock energy model classification framework\
  \ that leverages international modeling expertise from the participants of the International\
  \ Energy Agency's Annex 70 on Building Energy Epidemiology. Drawing from existing\
  \ classification studies, we propose a multi-layer quadrant scheme that classifies\
  \ modeling techniques by their design (top-down or bottom-up) and degree of transparency\
  \ (black-box or white-box); hybrid techniques are also addressed. The quadrant scheme\
  \ is unique from previous classification approaches in its non-hierarchical organization,\
  \ coverage of and ability to incorporate emerging modeling techniques, and treatment\
  \ of additional modeling dimensions. The new classification framework will be complemented\
  \ by a reporting protocol and online registry of existing models as part of ongoing\
  \ work in Annex 70 to increase the interpretability and utility of building stock\
  \ energy models for energy policy making.  "
