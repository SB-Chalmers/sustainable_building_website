abstract: 'Aim: This review aims to explore the relation between the physical office
  environment and employee health as found in the Nordic literature. Background: The
  Nordic countries have a worldwide fame for their high living and working standards.
  Nevertheless, they have also been facing global challenges related to demographic
  changes, aging population, and a rise in long term conditions which require a creative
  way of thinking, and innovative approaches in the ways we deliver buildings and
  the built environment. The built environment is a health determinant and a resource
  for health and wellbeing of building users. In office sector, however, there is
  little known regarding the design implications of the physical environment for health
  outcomes. A review of the literature on the current state of the art in the Nordic
  context could offer an opportunity to rethink office design and support dialogue
  on how better design can improve employee health outcomes. Methods: An explorative
  document analysis of recent literature on workplace environment in the Nordic context
  was carried out. Results: Three main gaps in the literature were identified, including
  (1) limited understanding of health, (2) unrecognised role of the physical work
  environment and design professions in relation to health, and (3) diverse research
  orientations. The combination of results suggests the paucity of the studies relating
  the physical office environment to positive health approaches. Conclusions: This
  review highlights the need for more quantitative and qualitative methods to give
  relevant knowledge for complex questions regarding the physical office environment
  and health outcomes of employees. Future research should enable dialogue and collaboration
  between different actors such as managers, human resources, occupational health
  professionals and designers, which can benefit the users of office building. Â© 2019
