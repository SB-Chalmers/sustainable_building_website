abstract: 'It has become increasingly important for also medium-sized building companies
  to internationalise.Many of these companies are not ready for that development and
  top level management need to learnhow to carry out steps of internationalisation.
  The aim of this paper is to create a competency modelfor top management teams of
  medium-sized, building companies and then second investigate a case ofa Swedish
  Engineering company, 3000 staff, doing an expansion to Norway. The analysis leads
  to afurther developed competency model for top management. The framework of understanding
  consistsof an overarching category, competency, and four further; leadership and
  teamwork, uncertainty, riskand resistance, international expansion, and cultural
  issues.Then empirical material, enables insightsand arguments that supports and/or
  contradicts the theoretical data for each of the identifiedcompetences. Three additional
  competencesis derived from the case study, leading to a total of tencompetences:
  learning during change, strategic leadership, dealing with risk and contingencies,embrace
  and redirect resistance, synergy orientation, managing local responsiveness, culturalmindsetappointing
  qualified personnel, efficient communication and business mindset.Missingcompetenceswere
  acquired through external consultants or recruitment. To achieve the desiredsynergies,management
  uses detailed checklists and processes, and place a person with a very stronginternal
  network as responsible for the integration project. Additionally, the findings indicate
  somemanagement focus on organizational culture.Managementassumed that through learning
  and adaptingto the organisational cultures, one automatically takes the national
  culture into account.  '
