abstract: 'The European building stock was renewed at a rapid pace during the period
  1950-1975. In many European countries the building stock from this time needs to
  be renovated. There is an opportunity to introduce energy efficiency measures in
  the renovation process, but in this process social aspects should also be taken
  into account. The purpose of this article is to provide an estimate of the economic
  and societal challenge of renovating and energy retrofitting the aging building
  stock. Building specific data on energy usage and previous renovation investments
  made in the multi-family dwellings in Gothenburg (N=5 098) is merged with data on
  tenure type and average income. Based on conducted energy retrofitting projects,
  costs are estimated for renovating and energy retrofitting multi-family dwellings
  that will reach the service life of 50 years before 2026. It is found that the pace
  of renovation needs to increase and that there is risk of increasing societal inequity
  due to rent increases in renovated buildings.  '
