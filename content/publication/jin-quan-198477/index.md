abstract: Tables of the one-body coefficients of fractional parentage are presented
  for the unitary group chain U(mn) ⊃ U(m) × U(n) and the graded unitary group chain
  U(mp + nq mq + np) ⊃ U( m n) × U( p q) with arbitrary m, n, p and q for systems
  having up to six particles. These coefficients are computed by using a program based
  on the fact that they are the isoscalar factors for the permutation group chain
  S(f) ⊃ S(f - 1), and thus are m and n (or m, n, p and q) independent. The S(f) ⊃
  S(f - 1) isoscalar factors are calculated by the eigenfunction method. Incidently,
  the program also provides an efficient way for constructing the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients
  of the permutation group. © 1984.
