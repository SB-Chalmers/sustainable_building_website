abstract: 'Today it is widely recognized that the construction industry plays a key
  role in the rational use of resources and the realization of a more sustainable
  society. Concerning buildings and energy use, renovation of the existing building
  stock to the higher energy performance is crucial. Among the various existing buildings
  in Europe, school buildings are of importance among the publicly owned buildings.
  However, there has been little effort in Sweden to promote the school building renovation
  by prefabricated wooden modules, which should be highly advantageous due to the
  short refurbishment period and its light weight.The present study investigated the
  hygrothermal property of wooden refurbishment modules in combination with an existing
  brick wall under Gothernburg (Sweden) climate. The criterion for the moisture safety
  inside the wall after the refurbishment was at 75% relative humidity in order to
  comply with the Swedish building regulation while it was assumed that the surface
  of the wall was wet from the precipitation during the refurbishment period. Two-dimensional
  transient heat and moisture transfer simulation was applied to three different module
  configurations. It was shown it is important to design the module vapour permeable
  so the entire wall system after the refurbishment have sufficient drying potential.  '
