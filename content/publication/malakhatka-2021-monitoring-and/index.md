abstract: "Today's commercially-off-the-shelf (COST) wearable devices can unobtrusively\
  \ capture several important parameters that may be used to measure the indoor comfort\
  \ of building occupants, including ambient air temperature, relative humidity, skin\
  \ temperature, perspiration rate, and heart rate. These data could be used not only\
  \ for improving personal wellbeing, but for adjusting a better indoor environment\
  \ condition. In this study, we have focused specifically on the sleeping phase.\
  \ The main purpose of this work was to use the data from wearable devices and smart\
  \ meters to improve the sleep quality of residents living at KTH Live-in-Lab. The\
  \ wearable device we used was the OURA ring which specializes in sleep monitoring.\
  \ In general, the data quality showed good potential for the modelling phase. For\
  \ the modelling phase, we had to make some choices, such as the programming language\
  \ and the AI algorithm, that was the best fit for our project. First, it aims to\
  \ make personal physiological data related studies more transparent. Secondly, the\
  \ tenants will have a better sleep quality in their everyday life if they have an\
  \ accurate prediction of the sleeping scores and ability to adjust the built environment.\
  \ Additionally, using knowledge about end users can help the building owners to\
  \ design better building systems and services related to the end-user's wellbeing.\
