abstract: "Understanding the global environmental impacts of local consumption is\
  \ an area of growing interest among policymakers and consumers. By knowing what\
  \ products comprise urban consumption “hotspots,” municipalities and consumers alike\
  \ could take deliberate actions to target and discourage consumption of high-impact\
  \ products. In this paper, a new method for identifying environmental hotspots of\
  \ consumption is presented. The main methodological advances are the following:\
  \ i) material flow analysis of urban areas and life cycle assessment are combined;\
  \ ii) a 16-year time-series of urban consumption data is used for selection of the\
  \ most suitable representative products and for trend analysis; iii) representative\
  \ products are selected systematically from consumption data of 1000 product types;\
  \ iv) representative products are scaled up to represent consumption of the product\
  \ groups; v) hotspots are identified by simultaneously evaluating six environmental\
  \ impacts - acidification, climate change, eutrophication (marine and freshwater),\
  \ photochemical ozone formation, and resource use; vi) for the case study, hotspots\
  \ are connected to the city's profiles. The method was applied to the Swedish cities\
  \ Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo and to Sweden in total. Electronics is a hotspot\
  \ for all the studied areas and all the studied impacts and should be a prioritized\
  \ product group for action. Fuel is a hotspot shared by all the areas while vehicles\
  \ is a hotspot in Gothenburg. Meat is a nationwide hotspot, but not for the cities\
  \ investigated. Gothenburg and Stockholm could collaborate to find effective measures\
  \ for their common hotspot machinery. Thus, the method can be used to identify hotspots\
  \ and find which product types could be part of national versus local programs.\
