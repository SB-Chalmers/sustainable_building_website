abstract: 'This article analyses practices and perceptions of stakeholders on including
  users in smart grids experiments in the Netherlands. In-depth interviews have been
  conducted and smart grid projects have been analysed, using a Strategic Niche Management
  framework. The analysis shows that there is a clear trend to pay more attention
  to users in new smart grid projects. However, too much focus on technology and economic
  incentives can become a barrier. Some institutional barriers have been identified.
  New innovative business models should be developed to explore different options
  to involve users. The many pilot and demonstration projects that are taking shape
  or are being planned offer an excellent opportunity for such an exploration. Learning
  on the social dimensions of smart grids, and the international exchange of experiences
  can prevent a premature lock-in in a particular pathway. Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.  '
