 abstract = {The subtropical regions are of interest of our time as it includes both developing anddeveloped regions. The applicability of a vapor-open wooden building envelope to those regions wasevaluated in terms of the longevity of the wood fiber insulation layer and its life time cost. Atlanta,New York City, Shanghai and Sydney were selected as representing cities with different economic setups.Transient heat and moisture transfer simulation and life time cost analysis of the envelope wascarried out. It was shown that regions with lower humidity load from exterior in the summer andhigher electricity price such as New York City have high potential to apply the system. In order toeven further promote such an envelope system in the regions with lower electricity price and higherhumidity load, it is required to employ materials with lower price and higher moisture sorptioncapacity.  },
