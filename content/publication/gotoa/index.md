abstract: 'The subtropical regions are of interest of our time as it includes both
  developing anddeveloped regions. The applicability of a vapor-open wooden building
  envelope to those regions wasevaluated in terms of the longevity of the wood fiber
  insulation layer and its life time cost. Atlanta,New York City, Shanghai and Sydney
  were selected as representing cities with different economic setups.Transient heat
  and moisture transfer simulation and life time cost analysis of the envelope wascarried
  out. It was shown that regions with lower humidity load from exterior in the summer
  andhigher electricity price such as New York City have high potential to apply the
  system. In order toeven further promote such an envelope system in the regions with
  lower electricity price and higherhumidity load, it is required to employ materials
  with lower price and higher moisture sorptioncapacity.  '
