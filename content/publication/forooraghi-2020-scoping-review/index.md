abstract: 'Purpose: This paper aims to explore the literature on office design approaches
  (ODAs) in relation to employee health. The overall goal is to facilitate the practical
  use and theoretical development of design approaches to healthy offices. Design/methodology/approach:
  A scoping review of 7,432 papers collected from 4 electronic databases and 5 scientific
  journals resulted in the selection of 18 papers for content analysis. Findings:
  Various ODAs relating to building design features and health were identified. The
  findings highlight challenges for this emergent field, including a paucity of literature
  on ODAs, a lack of definitions of health and healthy offices, ambiguous design strategies
  and a lack of a holistic ODA. Originality/value: ODAs are potentially valuable resources
  but an under-considered topic for healthy office development. To the best of the
  authorsâ€™ knowledge, this study is the first scoping review to map and compare different
  design approaches in the context of office design and its main contribution is in
  encouraging researchers and practitioners to bring a salutogenic and holistic perspective
  to their design approaches.  '
