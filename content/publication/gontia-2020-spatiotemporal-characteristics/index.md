abstract: "Residential buildings take a large share of the globally accumulated construction\
  \ material stock. Knowledge regarding material stocks and flows and the spatial\
  \ and temporal dynamics of residential structures is needed to enhance material\
  \ circularity and, consequently, reduce the inflow of raw materials and the outflow\
  \ of demolition waste. In this study, material stocks and flows in residential buildings\
  \ are estimated with the aim of identifying spatiotemporal characteristics among\
  \ different settlements. Sweden's 290 municipalities classified into eight settlement\
  \ types are used as a case study. The modeling is realized bottom-up, with statistical\
  \ inventory data and material intensity coefficients. The results demonstrate that,\
  \ in the last 25 years, 63% of the residential material stock in Sweden has accumulated\
  \ in the three largest metropolitan areas (Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malm√∂). In\
  \ contrast, rural areas and the commuter municipalities to small cities show a decrease\
  \ in material stocks. For the same period, particularities in material flows were\
  \ also depicted. For instance, medium-size towns presented the highest inflow and\
  \ outflow, commuter municipalities to large cities showed no outflow, and rural\
  \ areas with a visiting industry had a high stock renewal. The material composition\
  \ differs among settlements due to fluctuations in residential building type and\
  \ age distribution of the stock. Brick and steel have higher stock in larger settlements,\
  \ whereas wood and aggregate show higher stock in smaller, commuter and rural settlements.\
  \ Spatially, it was observed that residential stock mainly accumulates in large\
  \ cities located near the sea, and inland in medium-size towns along large transportation\
  \ infrastructures such as high-speed roads that connect the large cities. These\
  \ spatial observations indicate the formation of an intensively built human corridor,\
  \ which can be used for enhancing material circularity within the national boundaries.\
  \ The results point to spatial and temporal particularities in material stocks and\
  \ flows among settlement types and, therefore, further related research is recommended.\
  \ This study also contributes with an extensive discussion on drivers of stock accumulation,\
  \ policy implications, uncertainties, and results validation.  "
