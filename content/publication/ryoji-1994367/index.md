abstract: Fracture tests of aluminum/epoxy dissimilar materials with an interface
  crack are carried out under comprehensive mixed mode conditions, using circular
  disk type (brazil-nut-sandwich) specimens under compression or tension loading in
  various directions. The stress intensity factors for an interface crack are analyzed
  by the boundary element method, and the fracture criteria for an interface crack
  are investigated and discussed based on the interfacial fracture mechanics. In the
  brazil-nut-sandwich compression tests, the crack kinks into the epoxy resin and
  the fracture angles are well predicted by the σ0max criterion proposed by the authors.
  In the brazil-nut-sandwich tension tests, the crack grows along the interface and
  the mixed mode fracture criteria are clarified experimentally. A method to evaluate
  the possible path and the strength of the interface crack is proposed by comparison
  with both criteria. © 1994.
