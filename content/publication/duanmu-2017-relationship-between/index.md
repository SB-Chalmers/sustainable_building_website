abstract: 'Architectural design is based on the reliability and rationality of construction
  standards. The thermal comfort standard is a very important part of construction
  standards. In this study, Chinese researches about the field survey of various areas
  were summarized. The distribution range of thermal comfo rt temperature and neutral
  temperature were obtained by using the PMV evaluation index. The neutral temperature
  of different types of buildings in different seasons was summarized. Its relationship
  with indoor parameters was analyzed in detail. These findings provide a basis for
  the formulation of building specifications and architectural design in future.  '
