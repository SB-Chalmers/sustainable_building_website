abstract: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is increasingly applied to evaluate the environmental
  performance of buildings. However, current tools for building LCA require detailed
  information not available in the decisive early design stages. As a result, LCA
  is usually applied as post-design evaluation and not used to improve the building
  design. The goal of this paper is to adapt the method of structured under-specified
  LCA to the Swiss context and implement it in a design-integrated tool. The users
  of the tool should be able to get a complete estimation of the life cycle impact
  based on very few inputs, such as building type, intended use and structural system.
  In addition, the tool should allow to replace these assumptions with more detailed
  information step by step throughout the design process. The paper describes the
  development of a structured database and a parametric tool. Furthermore, it exemplifies
  the intended workflow during the design process on a building design. The presented
  approach can be scaled up and adapted to the needs of other national contexts in
  the future. It facilitates environmental performance optimisation of buildings and
  supports making use of the big potential the building sector has regarding contributing
  towards climate action (UN SDG 13).
