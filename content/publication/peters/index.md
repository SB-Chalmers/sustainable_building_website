abstract: "The article entitled ‘Review: the availability of life-cycle studies in\
  \ Sweden' by Croft and colleagues (January 2019, volume 24, issue 1, pages 6–11)\
  \ has puzzled many researchers in Sweden. The stated purpose of the article is to\
  \ review the availability of water and carbon footprinting studies and life-cycle\
  \ assessment (LCA) studies in Sweden. Despite its title and purpose suggesting otherwise,\
  \ the article appears to be about the accessibility of life-cycle case studies from\
  \ Sweden in South Africa. It is problematic that the article claims to be a review\
  \ in the title and text, but is presented by the journal as a commentary. We believe\
  \ that the article's method is unclear and that its title and results are misleading.\
  \ The authors of the article found only 12 academic papers, 10 academic theses,\
  \ 8 company reports, and 1 presentation. This result significantly underestimates\
  \ the actual production and availability of Swedish LCA case studies.  "
