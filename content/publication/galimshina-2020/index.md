abstract: Building renovation is urgently required to decrease the energy consumption
  of the existing building stock and reduce greenhouse gas emissions coming from the
  building sector. Selecting an appropriate renovation strategy is challenging due
  to the long building service life and consequent uncertainties. In this paper, we
  propose a new framework for the robust assessment of renovation strategies in terms
  of environmental and economic performance of the building's life cycle. First, we
  identify the possible renovation strategies and define the probability distributions
  for 74 uncertain parameters. Second, we create an integrated workflow for Life Cycle
  Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost analysis (LCC) and make use of Sobol' indices
  to identify a prioritization strategy for the renovation. Finally, the selected
  renovation scenario is assessed by metamodeling techniques to calculate its robustness.
  The results of three case studies of residential buildings from different construction
  periods show that the priority in renovation should be given to the heating system
  replacement, which is followed by the exterior wall insulation and windows. This
  result is not in agreement with common renovation practices and this discrepancy
  is discussed at the end of the paper.
