abstract: "A discussion of sustainability in architecture cannot be meaningfully carried\
  \ out without the inclusion of most buildings' central purpose, namely the provision\
  \ of indoor environments that are accommodating of occupants' needs and requirements.\
  \ To this end, building designers and operators are expected to demonstrate compliance\
  \ with codes and standards pertaining to indoor environmental quality (IEQ). However,\
  \ the majority of conventional IEQ standards, codes, and guidelines have a single-domain\
  \ character, in that they address IEQ in terms of a number of isolated domains (i.e.,\
  \ thermal, visual, acoustic, air quality). In this context, the present contribution\
  \ explores the current state of multi-domain IEQ evaluation approaches and the necessary\
  \ conditions for their further development and application. Toward this end, a number\
  \ of common building rating schemes were selected and analyzed in detail. The results\
  \ of this assessment imply the necessity of both short-term improvements of the\
  \ existing schemes in terms of the transparency and plausibility of the applied\
  \ point allocation and weighting strategies and the fundamental need for a deeper\
  \ empirically grounded understanding of the nature of occupants' perception of and\
  \ behavior in the built environments.  "
