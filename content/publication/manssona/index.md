abstract: 'By introducing doors on refrigerated display cabinets, the energy demand
  is substantially decreased. However, there exist significant discrepancies in temperature
  readings between visually identical refrigerated display cabinets equipped with
  doors. This study explores the cause and consequences of these differences. The
  exploratory methodology used within the study has used CFD simulations combined
  with laboratory experiments to conclude that there exists a thermal gradient in
  the area of the return air temperature sensor causing these discrepancies to occur.
  Thus, the temperature sensors position within the thermal gradient affects the perceived
  temperature of the control system and thereby the refrigeration strategy adopted
  by it. To follow up on the consequences of this observed issue, two field studies
  were performed to investigate the effects and occurrence of temperature sensors
  within the thermal gradient. Through this, it was concluded that by moving the return
  air sensors away from the thermal gradient, the refrigerated display cabinets were
  performing more uniformly as well as with a reduced heat extraction demand. Additionally,
  from the field study investigating the occurrence, it was found that 80.5% of the
  221 reviewed refrigerated display cabinets had sensors placed in a zone where a
  thermal gradient exists.  '
