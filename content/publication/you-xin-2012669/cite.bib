 abstract = {Embryo-sac abortion is one of the most important reasons for hybrid sterility between indica and japonica infspecies. Wide compatibility gene S 5 n can overcome the embryo-sac sterility between indica-japonica hybrids caused by the S5 locus located on chromosome 6. In this paper, key sequence analysis and functional molecular markers were used to identify S 5 n gene-harboring genotypes from 646 rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes, including 323 cultivated and 323 wild rice genotypes. Whole-mount eosin B-staining confocal laser scanning microscopy was employed to observe the embryo-sac fertility of hybrids. A total of 28 genotypes, including 16 cultivated, 9 Oryza rufipogon accessions, and 3 Oryza nivara accessions, were found to have the S 5 n gene. These results suggested that the S 5 n gene differentiated and evolved from wild rice. Different indica-japonica hybrids were developed using O. sativa genotypes carrying the S 5 n gene and without the S 5 n gene. Embryosac fertility was more than 93% in the S 5 n gene-harboring hybrids, whereas embryo-sac fertility was relatively low in control hybrids between typical indica and japonica cultivars without the S 5 n gene, suggesting that S 5 n can overcome the sterility between indica-japonica hybrids. Furthermore, it verified the reliability of molecular functional markers to detect S 5 n gene-harboring genotypes. Functional molecular markers used in the present study will be very useful to identify S 5 n gene-harboring genotypes, and genotypes detected with the S 5 n gene in the present study are very important germplasm for overcoming intersubspecific hybrid sterility.
