abstract: Embryo-sac abortion is one of the most important reasons for hybrid sterility
  between indica and japonica infspecies. Wide compatibility gene S 5 n can overcome
  the embryo-sac sterility between indica-japonica hybrids caused by the S5 locus
  located on chromosome 6. In this paper, key sequence analysis and functional molecular
  markers were used to identify S 5 n gene-harboring genotypes from 646 rice (Oryza
  sativa L.) genotypes, including 323 cultivated and 323 wild rice genotypes. Whole-mount
  eosin B-staining confocal laser scanning microscopy was employed to observe the
  embryo-sac fertility of hybrids. A total of 28 genotypes, including 16 cultivated,
  9 Oryza rufipogon accessions, and 3 Oryza nivara accessions, were found to have
  the S 5 n gene. These results suggested that the S 5 n gene differentiated and evolved
  from wild rice. Different indica-japonica hybrids were developed using O. sativa
  genotypes carrying the S 5 n gene and without the S 5 n gene. Embryosac fertility
  was more than 93% in the S 5 n gene-harboring hybrids, whereas embryo-sac fertility
  was relatively low in control hybrids between typical indica and japonica cultivars
  without the S 5 n gene, suggesting that S 5 n can overcome the sterility between
  indica-japonica hybrids. Furthermore, it verified the reliability of molecular functional
  markers to detect S 5 n gene-harboring genotypes. Functional molecular markers used
  in the present study will be very useful to identify S 5 n gene-harboring genotypes,
  and genotypes detected with the S 5 n gene in the present study are very important
  germplasm for overcoming intersubspecific hybrid sterility. Â© Crop Science Society
