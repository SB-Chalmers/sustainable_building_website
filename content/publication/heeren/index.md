abstract: 'The building stock is one of the most important energy consumers worldwide.
  Therefore, a number of energy reduction targets and regulations exist for the construction
  sector. Different building stock models have been developed in order to investigate
  the potentials of energy-efficiency and changes in energy source in the building
  stock. However,these models often have important shortcomings, since they are single-issued
  and do not include the life cycle of buildings. Thus,we propose an innovative assessment
  methodology in the form of a life cycle-based building stock model(LC-Build). The
  building stock is clustered in building cohorts of similar construction and equipment
  characteristics in terms oftype, construction period and building technology systems.
  The most important building components are assigned specific thermal transmittance
  values. Figures for diffusion and retrofit rate describe the development of the
  building stock fabric. Additionally,environmental impact from the energy supply
  side is taken into account. This approach facilitates the evaluation of the effectiveness
  of measures and their dynamics on the building stock, such as newer and more efficient
  technologies and practicesrelated to energy policies and prices.Furthermore, the
  model has a direct relationship to the construction activity(energy-efficiency measures,
  substitution of fossil energy based heating systems) and fosters the comprehension
  of material flows, related environmental impact,and costs.The practicality of this
  approach is demonstrated by means of a case study in the city of Zurich in Switzerland.
  The results suggest that Zurich has are markable potential to reduce its greenhouse
  gas emissions from the building sector: 85% by 2050. The case study highlights the
  advantages of the proposed modeling approach. The LC-Build is a valuable tool to
  identify and test sustainable energy targets for building stocks, such as the European
  20–20–20 target.  '
