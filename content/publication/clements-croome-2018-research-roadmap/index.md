abstract: 'Intelligence has three parts cognitive, emotional and practical. A building
  needs to reflect this. So an intelligent building will responsive to people in terms
  of not only being functional but to the human senses besides serving a community
  in the location. It will be resource effective in terms of energy , water and waste
  with low pollution. It will be smart in terms of technology selected to enable the
  systems to respond effectively but also make them easier for people to use. Today
  there is a focus on health and wellbeing and so intelligent buildings must produce
  a healing environment. Buildings need to be functional and practical but also expressive.
  Equally important is the infrastructure that services buildings and the people moving
  between them.  '
