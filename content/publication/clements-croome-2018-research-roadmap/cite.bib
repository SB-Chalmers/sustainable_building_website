 abstract = {Intelligence has three parts cognitive, emotional and practical. A building needs to reflect this. So an intelligent building will responsive to people in terms of not only being functional but to the human senses besides serving a community in the location. It will be resource effective in terms of energy , water and waste with low pollution. It will be smart in terms of technology selected to enable the systems to respond effectively but also make them easier for people to use. Today there is a focus on health and wellbeing and so intelligent buildings must produce a healing environment. Buildings need to be functional and practical but also expressive. Equally important is the infrastructure that services buildings and the people moving between them.  },
