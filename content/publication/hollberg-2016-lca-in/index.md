abstract: 'Purpose Life cycle assessment (LCA) has not been widely applied in the
  building design process because it is perceived to be complex and time-consuming.
  There is a high demand for simplified approaches that architects can use without
  detailed knowledge of LCA. This paper presents a parametric LCA approach, which
  allows architects to efficiently reduce the environmental impact of building designs.
  Methods First, the requirements for design-integrated LCA are analyzed. Then, assumptions
  to simplify the required data input are made and a parametric model is established.
  The model parametrizes all input, including building geometry, materials, and boundary
  conditions, and calculates the LCA in real time. The parametric approach possesses
  the advantage that input parameters can be adjusted easily and quickly. The architect
  has two options to improve the design: either through manually changing geometry,
  building materials, and building services, or through the use of an optimization
  solver. The parametric model was implemented in a parametric design software and
  applied using two cases: (a) the design of a new multi-residential building, and
  (b) retrofitting of a single-family house. Results and discussion We have successfully
  demonstrated the capability of the approach to find a solution with minimum environmental
  impact for both examples. In the first example, the parametric method is used to
  manually compare geometric design variants. The LCA is calculated based on assumptions
  for materials and building services. In the second example, evolutionary algorithms
  are employed to find the optimum combination of insulation material, heating system,
  and windows for retrofitting. We find that there is not one optimum insulation thickness,
  but many optima, depending on the individual boundary conditions and the chosen
  environmental indicator. Conclusions By incorporating a simplified LCA into the
  design process, the additional effort of performing LCA is minimized. The parametric
  approach allows the architect to focus on his main task of designing the building
  and finally makes LCA practically useful for design optimization. In the future,
  further performance analysis capabilities such as life cycle costing can also be
  integrated.  '
