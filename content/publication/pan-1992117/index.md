abstract: Analytic expressions are given for the SO(6)-reduced matrix elements of
  the non-generators of the SO(8) group, along with the fundamental SO(8)⊃SO(6)×SO(2)
  isoscalar factors by the vector coherent state technique for facilitating calculations
  of the symmetry-breaking terms in the SO(8)⊃SO(6) fermion dynamical symmetry model.
