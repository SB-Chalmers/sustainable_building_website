abstract: 'The project investigates glazed geometries in residential buildings as
  a robust solution from a health and resource perspective (primarily energy and cultivation).
  Our hypothesis is that that glazed geometries, with a more adapted volume, can increase
  well-being and social interaction without increased energy use. The studied geometries
  are primarily spaces for communication and leisure in residential buildings, consisting
  of wind protected glazed areas such as atria, entrances and stairways. Furthermore,
  these geometries may have varying indoor climate that is governed mainly by the
  building itself and residents, rather than by building services. The project will
  contribute with examples of new well-performing geometries and usage (such as larger
  entrances with social areas), and methods to evaluate the performance early in the
  design process (with respect to indoor environmental quality and energy efficiency)
  and to provide guidance for architectural design and increased social interaction.
  In the initial stage of the project, examples of glazed geometries at buildings
  have been identified and inventories at these buildings have been performed to gather
  relevant data from the design phase (e.g. building permits and interviews with consultants),
  to the use phase (e.g. interviews with users and maintenance staff) and follow up
  (e.g. energy performance certificates). At the initial stage, the users are the
  most important people to interview since they provide information on the key aspects
  of the project, i.e. wellbeing in the spaces. This includes thermal comfort, acoustics,
  indoor air quality and, in particular social interaction and usage of spaces.  '
