 abstract = {The project investigates glazed geometries in residential buildings as a robust solution from a health and resource perspective (primarily energy and cultivation). Our hypothesis is that that glazed geometries, with a more adapted volume, can increase well-being and social interaction without increased energy use. The studied geometries are primarily spaces for communication and leisure in residential buildings, consisting of wind protected glazed areas such as atria, entrances and stairways. Furthermore, these geometries may have varying indoor climate that is governed mainly by the building itself and residents, rather than by building services. The project will contribute with examples of new well-performing geometries and usage (such as larger entrances with social areas), and methods to evaluate the performance early in the design process (with respect to indoor environmental quality and energy efficiency) and to provide guidance for architectural design and increased social interaction. In the initial stage of the project, examples of glazed geometries at buildings have been identified and inventories at these buildings have been performed to gather relevant data from the design phase (e.g. building permits and interviews with consultants), to the use phase (e.g. interviews with users and maintenance staff) and follow up (e.g. energy performance certificates). At the initial stage, the users are the most important people to interview since they provide information on the key aspects of the project, i.e. wellbeing in the spaces. This includes thermal comfort, acoustics, indoor air quality and, in particular social interaction and usage of spaces.  },
