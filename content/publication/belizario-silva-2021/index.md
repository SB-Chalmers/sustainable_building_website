abstract: "Reducing the embodied carbon of reinforced concrete structures is crucial\
  \ to mitigate climate change. Several stakeholders in the construction value chain\
  \ can contribute to this effort. Therefore, this work quantifies the influence of\
  \ various decisions made by different stakeholders on the global warming potential\
  \ (GWP) of a reinforced concrete structure. These decisions include the structural\
  \ design, material embodied impact, transportation distances, and construction practices.\
  \ Herein, each decision is modelled as an uncertainty source and its contribution\
  \ to the total uncertainty of the structure's GWP is assessed. Two scenarios are\
  \ considered: business-as-usual, which only considers conventional concrete mix\
  \ design, and an innovation scenario, which also considers the option of high-filler\
  \ low-water concrete. In the business-as-usual scenario, the structure's GWP varies\
  \ from 165 t CO2e to 336 t CO2e, and the most influential decision is the structural\
  \ design, which accounts for 56% of the total uncertainty, followed by decisions\
  \ associated with materials production and supplier selection. Meanwhile, in the\
  \ innovation scenario, the structure's GWP varies from 126 t CO2e to 336 t CO2e,\
  \ wherein the choice between conventional and the innovative concrete mix design\
  \ is the most influential decision, contributing 60% of the total uncertainty. Overall,\
  \ the relative importance of stakeholders can be identified to prioritise improvement\
  \ measures, including implementing innovative technologies."
