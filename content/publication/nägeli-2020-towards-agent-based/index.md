abstract: 'Buildings are responsible for a large share of the energy demand and greenhouse
  gas (GHG) emissions in Europe and Switzerland. Bottom-up building stock models (BSMs)
  can be used to assess policy measures and strategies based on a quantitative assessment
  of energy demand and GHG emissions in the building stock over time. Recent developments
  in BSM-related research have focused on modeling the status quo of the stock and
  comparatively little focus has been given to improving the modeling methods in terms
  of stock dynamics. This paper presents a BSM based on an agent-based modeling approach
  (ABBSM) that models stock development in terms of new construction, retrofit and
  replacement by modeling individual decisions on the building level. The model was
  implemented for the residential building stock of Switzerland and results show that
  it can effectively reproduce the past development of the stock from 2000 to 2017
  based on the changes in policy, energy prices, and costs. ABBSM improves on current
  modeling practice by accounting for heterogeneity in the building stock and its
  effect on uptake of retrofit and renewable heating systems and by incorporating
  both regulatory or financial policy measures as well as other driving and restricting
  factors (costs, energy prices).  '
