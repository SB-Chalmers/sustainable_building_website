abstract: Digital tools based on Building Information Modelling (BIM) provide the
  potential to facilitate environmental performance assessments of buildings. Various
  tools that use a BIM model for automatic quantity take-off as basis for Life Cycle
  Assessment (LCA) have been developed recently. This paper describes the first application
  of such a BIM-LCA tool to evaluate the embodied global warming potential (GWP) throughout
  the whole design process of a real building. 34 states of the BIM model are analysed
  weekly. The results show that the embodied GWP during the design phase is twice
  as high as for the final building. These changes can be mainly attributed to the
  designers' approach of using placeholder materials that are refined later, besides
  other reasons. As such, the embodied GWP is highly overestimated and a BIM-based
  environmental assessment during the design process could be misleading and counterproductive.
  Finally, three alternatives to the established automatic quantity take-off are discussed
  for future developments.
