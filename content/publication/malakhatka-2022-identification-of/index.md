abstract: 'This exploratory study analyses the daily activities of the end-user in
  terms of assessing the potential for conserving direct and indirect energy. In the
  course of the study, a socio-technological system approach was applied, which made
  it possible to combine the methods of analysis and interaction of the social group
  (students) and technical infrastructure (living laboratory). The method of creating
  personas was also applied to segregate a large group of the population within one
  segment. This approach allowed us to consider in more detail the different types
  of behavior in the same segment. As a result, we got more personalized strategies
  for changing a behavior tailored for each individual persona. In conclusion, a recommendation
  was given on which policies implications and to which organizations to address.  '
