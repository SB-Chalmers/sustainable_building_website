abstract: 'Geosynthetics made from plastics can replace filter layers made of gravel.
  In this article goal and scope, basic data and the results of a comparative life
  cycle assessment of gravel and geosynthetics based filter layers are described.
  The filter layers of a road made of 30 cm gravel and a filter geosynthetic, respectively,
  form the basis for the comparison. The filter layers have the same technical performance
  and the same life time of 30 years. The product system includes the supply of the
  raw materials, the manufacture of the geotextiles and the extraction of mineral
  resources, the construction of the road filter, its use and its end of life phase.
  The life cycle assessment reveals that the geosynthetics based filter layer causes
  lower environmental impacts per square metre. The cumulative greenhouse gas emissions
  amount to 7.8 kg CO2-eq (mineral filter) and to 0.81 kg CO2-eq (geosynthetic filter).
  The variation of the thickness of the gravel based filter layer confirms the lower
  environmental impacts of a geosynthetics based filter layer. Environmental impacts
  of the geosynthetic production are dominated by the raw material provision (plastic
  granulate) and electricity consumption during manufacturing.  '
