abstract: 'Renovating the existing building stock has a significant potential to achieve
  the goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the European Union. However,
  a common European renovation project focuses primarily on improving the thermal
  performance of the building shell by adding insulation to the opaque surfaces and
  improve the thermal performance of the windows. The potentially positive contribution
  of renewable energies (RE) in balance with energy efficiency measures is often underestimated.
  Consequently, a more holistic approach can contribute to a reduction in total net
  energy demand up to 40-45% for the entire buildings sector. Thus, in order to achieve
  the goal of GHG emission reduction in an economic most responsible way, the share
  of RE in a renovation project needs to be increased. However, building renovation
  projects are becoming - apparently - more complicated if more factors are considered
  in the planning of a renovation project. Thus, a computational tool for evaluating
  hundreds of different renovation options, including the implementations of renewable
  energy resources, to obtain an optimal or nearly optimal set of renovation options
  is essential. Therefore, a novel planning tool has been developed within the framework
  of DREEAM project, a project funded by the European Union within the Horizon 2020
  research framework. The DREEAM-Tool has been designed in the way that it helps designers
  and other stakeholders to plan a renovation project of a single building or even
  on a multi-building scale. The tool was built in the way to optimize the renovation
  project taking into consideration the most critical factors in planning and decision-making
  processes, such as the economic or environmental performance. In other words, the
  tool combines an energy calculation model for a building or multiple building with
  an economic and environmental assessment to identify and optimize the most beneficial
  refurbishment solutions. The current study presents the concept of the DREEAM-Tool
  and shows examples of how the optimal renovation packages of a considered building
  will be determined and how this will support designers or buildings owners in decision-making
  processes.  '
