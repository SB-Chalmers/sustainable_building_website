abstract: 'In order to transform the economy into one that is circular, that recovers
  most materials through reuse, remanufacturing and recycling, these activities need
  to grow significantly. Waste management has substantially incorporated recycling
  as an end-of-life treatment but has still largely failed to incorporate remanufacturing
  and reuse as possible material recovery routes. This article aims to provide useful
  information to establish centers for urban remanufacture (CUREs), by analyzing fifteen
  existing initiatives that facilitate reuse and remanufacture by providing access
  to secondary materials or manufacturing tools. The study consists of a review of
  selected initiatives complemented with targeted interviews to fill in missing information.
  Most initiatives provided access to secondary materials (13 of 15 initiatives),
  and almost all used different manufacturing tools (14 of 15 initiatives). Besides
  their regular opening hours, initiatives were mainly engaged in capacity building
  activities, which were done through predefined or improvised workshops. Most initiatives
  relied on external support to finance their operations (9 of 15 initiatives). However,
  one of the self-financed initiatives is the oldest initiative in the study, operating
  since 1998. Based on the results and tacit knowledge collected in this study, a
  framework is suggested to serve as a guide for establishing future CUREs.  '
