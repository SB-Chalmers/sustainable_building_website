 abstract = {A variety of event detection algorithms for microblog services have been proposed, but their accuracy relies on the microblog feeds they analyse. Existing research explores datasets that are collected using either a set of manually predefined terms or information from external sources. These methods fail to provide comprehensive and quality feeds for real-time event detection. In this paper, we present a novel adaptive keyword identification approach to retrieve a greater amount of event relevant content. This approach continuously monitors emerging hashtags and rates them by their similarity to specific pre-defined event hashtags using TF-IDF vectors. Top rated emerging hashtags are added as filter criteria in real time. By comparing our proposed approach, called CETRe (Contentbased Event Tweet Retrieval) with an existing baseline approach applied to real-world events, we show that CETRe not only identifies event topics and contents, but also enables better event detection. © 2014 IEEE.},
