abstract: A variety of event detection algorithms for microblog services have been
  proposed, but their accuracy relies on the microblog feeds they analyse. Existing
  research explores datasets that are collected using either a set of manually predefined
  terms or information from external sources. These methods fail to provide comprehensive
  and quality feeds for real-time event detection. In this paper, we present a novel
  adaptive keyword identification approach to retrieve a greater amount of event relevant
  content. This approach continuously monitors emerging hashtags and rates them by
  their similarity to specific pre-defined event hashtags using TF-IDF vectors. Top
  rated emerging hashtags are added as filter criteria in real time. By comparing
  our proposed approach, called CETRe (Contentbased Event Tweet Retrieval) with an
  existing baseline approach applied to real-world events, we show that CETRe not
  only identifies event topics and contents, but also enables better event detection.
