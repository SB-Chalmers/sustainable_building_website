abstract: 'Timber roof constructions are commonly ventilated through an air cavity
  beneath the roof sheathing in order to remove heat and moisture from the construction.
  The driving forces for this ventilation are wind pressure and thermal buoyancy.
  The wind driven ventilation has been studied extensively, while models for predicting
  buoyant flow are less developed. In the present study, a novel analytical model
  is presented to predict the air flow caused by thermal buoyancy in a ventilated
  roof construction. The model provides means to calculate the cavity Rayleigh number
  for the roof construction, which is then correlated with the air flow rate. The
  model predictions are compared to the results of an experimental and a numerical
  study examining the effect of different cavity designs and inclinations on the air
  flow rate in a ventilated roof subjected to varying heat loads. Over 80 different
  test set-ups, the analytical model was found to replicate both experimental and
  numerical results within an acceptable margin. The effect of an increased total
  roof height, air cavity height and solar heat load for a given construction is an
  increased air flow rate through the air cavity. On average, the analytical model
  predicts a 3% higher air flow rate than found in the numerical study, and a 20%
  lower air flow rate than found in the experimental study, for comparable test set-ups.
  The model provided can be used to predict the air flow rate in cavities of varying
  design, and to quantify the impact of suggested roof design changes. The result
  can be used as a basis for estimating the moisture safety of a roof construction.  '
