abstract: 'PurposeThe share of variable renewable energy sources (vRES) in the German
  electricity grid has increased over the past few decades. Due to the nature of the
  generation pattern of vRES, the increase of vRES causes the emission factor (EF)
  to fluctuate on an hourly basis. This fluctuation raises concerns about the accuracy
  of quantifying emissions with the current metric of the annual average EF as the
  respective EF may change depending on the time at which it is consumed.MethodsThe
  study calculated the hourly EF of Germany from 2011 to 2015 and investigated the
  effect of an increase of vRES on the EF. The calculated hourly EF was clustered
  based on three aspects of time: the period of time, the time of a day, and the day
  of the week.Results and discussionThe study showed a higher proportion of vRES on
  weekend daytimes while the weekday nighttimes resulted in a lower share than the
  annual average. The study highlighted potential underestimation and overestimation
  of emissions by using annual average EF which ranged from +22% (2015 weekday nighttime
  of October) to âˆ’34% (2015 weekend daytime of May).ConclusionsThe study suggested
  that the application of hourly EF may be necessary to quantify the respective emission
  from the consumers that use electricity during the weekend daytime and weekend nighttime.
  For consumer use at other times, the emissions could be quantified appropriately
  by using the conventional annual average EF.  '
