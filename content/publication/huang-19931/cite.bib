 abstract = {Integrated flight and propulsion control systems will require propulsion systems to reduce in time to accelerate engine and to improve transient performance for a full flight envelope operation. A multivariable model reference adaptive control (MRAC) scheme is proposed in this paper. Acceleration time is reduced by uptrimming engine pressure ratio in some operating conditions and in parts of the flight envelope where excess stall margin and turbine temperature margin exist. The MRAC scheme is obtained by using Liapunov direct method. Simulation studies are performed for a two-spool turbojet engine.},
