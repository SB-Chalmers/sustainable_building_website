abstract: 'The sand surrounding a construction (e.g. monopile) for mounting an offshore
  wind turbine, could be scoured due to the affection of natural water flow at the
  ocean floor. To tackle the phenomena, scour protection methods have been established.
  Mostly rocks are used, but also one alternative, described in this paper, has been
  used already successfully: The installation of Geotextile Sand Containers.  '
