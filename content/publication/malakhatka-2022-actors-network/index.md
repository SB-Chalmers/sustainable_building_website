abstract: 'In the scientific literature and in practice, quite a lot of attention
  is paidto the actors’ network analysis in living labs. Still, there is a lack of
  studies onvalue exchange between different actors in living laboratories. This study
  selectedthe distributed structure of the actors’ network in living lab since most
  European residential laboratories function according to this model. In the course
  of this exploratory study, we conducted two workshops: the first with participants
  from several European residential laboratories to discuss and co-design a framework
  for analyzingthe exchange of value between different stakeholders, and the second
  workshop—case study, where the proposed framework was applied on the actors network
  of the existed living laboratory—KTH Live-in-Lab. As a result, we got a detailed
  pictureof the network of actors and value exchange within the value co-creation
  model forKTH Live-in-Lab (Smart Home Services project).  '
