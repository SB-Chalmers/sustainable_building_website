abstract: 'In this study we report a review of scientific literature, published from
  the year 2000 to 2014, aiming to identify the current best practices in sustainability
  assessment, including planning, of transport infrastructures together with current
  issues and knowledge gaps. Sustainability assessments of transport infrastructures
  are slowly increasing around the world and the practices vary considerably. Current
  applied methods rely basically on Environmental impact assessment (EIA) or Strategic
  environmental assessment (SEA) procedures, which in turn often contain one or more
  procedures such as Cost-benefit analysis (CBA), Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) and
  Life cycle analysis (LCA). In several countries legal frameworks exist for sustainability
  assessment of transport infrastructures, for instance the EIA and SEA Directives
  in Europe. However, limitations of EIA and SEA are acknowledged in literature, although
  a few studies report improved sustainability assessments. Suggestions are also made
  in literature to introduce wider perspectives in order to consider sustainability
  aspects more properly, e.g. the inclusion of social indicators. Assessments aiming
  at the consideration of sustainability aspects and influencing the strategic planning
  of these complex systems are rare and methods are in their infancy. Key issues and
  knowledge gaps that are in need of being further addressed by research include the
  requirement to cover wider spatial and temporal scales, the consideration of cumulative
  and indirect effects and a more effective incorporation of stakeholders. Other highlighted
  issues are inadequate monitoring of project outcomes and the general lack of combination
  of knowledge from different knowledge fields.  '
