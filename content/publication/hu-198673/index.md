abstract: The coastal pusher-barge system is an assembly of the pusher and barge connected
  by special couplers. Usually it has a more efficient utilization of the main engine
  and a better circulative transportation compared with conventional ships, and therefore
  provides more economical benefit on some routes. In this paper the optimum pattern
  of pusher-barge system is given and its economical property calculated. Problems
  in the development of the pusher-barge system transportation in our country are
  discussed.
