 abstract = {The coastal pusher-barge system is an assembly of the pusher and barge connected by special couplers. Usually it has a more efficient utilization of the main engine and a better circulative transportation compared with conventional ships, and therefore provides more economical benefit on some routes. In this paper the optimum pattern of pusher-barge system is given and its economical property calculated. Problems in the development of the pusher-barge system transportation in our country are discussed.},
