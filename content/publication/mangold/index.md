abstract: '© 2018 by the authors. The European building stock was renewed at a rapid
  pace during the period 1950-1975. In many European countries, the building stock
  from this time needs to be renovated, and there are opportunities to introduce energy
  efficiency measures in the renovation process. Information availability and increasingly
  available analysis tools make it possible to assess the impact of policy and regulation.
  This article describes methods developed for analyzing investments in renovation
  and energy performance based on building ownership and inhabitant socio-economic
  information developed for Swedish authorities, to be used for the Swedish national
  renovations strategy in 2019. This was done by analyzing measured energy usage and
  renovation investments made during the last 30 years, coupled with building specific
  official information of buildings and resident area characteristics, for multi-family
  dwellings in Gothenburg (N = 6319). The statistical analyses show that more costly
  renovations lead to decreasing energy usage for heating, but buildings that have
  been renovated during the last decades have a higher energy usage when accounting
  for current heating system, ownership, and resident socio-economic background. It
  is appropriate to include an affordability aspect in larger renovation projects
  since economically disadvantaged groups are over-represented in buildings with poorer
  energy performance.  '
