abstract: Fracture criteria of an interface crack out of the interface between two
  dissimilar isotropic elastic solids are proposed and discussed. The present criterion
  is based on the maximum stress (σθmax) which can be characterized by the stress
  intensity factors for an interface crack before kinking. The predicted kinking angles
  are compared with those obtained by He and Hutchinson's energy release rate criterion
  and also with some experimental results. © 1992.
