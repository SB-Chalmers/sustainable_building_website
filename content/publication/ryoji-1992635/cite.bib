 abstract = {Fracture criteria of an interface crack out of the interface between two dissimilar isotropic elastic solids are proposed and discussed. The present criterion is based on the maximum stress (σθmax) which can be characterized by the stress intensity factors for an interface crack before kinking. The predicted kinking angles are compared with those obtained by He and Hutchinson's energy release rate criterion and also with some experimental results. © 1992.},
